Since that steep decline would happen over just a few\\nmonths and would follow smaller cuts earlier this year, it would mark an\\nacceleration in price-cutting, which typically runs 20% to 25% a year in the PC\\nmarket.  \\n<p>\\n   Other PCs could drop to about $750, breaking the consumer-electronics price\\nbarrier and ending up on more back-to-school and Christmas lists.  \\n<p>\\n   Most PC makers won\\'t discuss the possibility of a new round of price cuts.\\nPrivately, they admit that to do so could prompt consumers to postpone\\npurchases -- something shoppers may well want to consider.  \\n<p>\\n   Aggressive price cuts loom mainly because the industry, for the first time\\nin almost three years, can almost meet customer demand. That could lead to\\ndiscounts of 20% or more, analysts and distributors say. At the same time,\\nprices of the microprocessor \"brain,\" disk drives and other parts are falling\\nsharply, and that could send PC prices down even more. On the distribution\\nside, competition is growing in both the wholesale and retail parts of the\\nbusiness.  \\n<p>\\n   \"When supply and demand cross, it\\'s going to become a game of market share,\\nand manufacturers will do what they have to do,\" says James F. Halpin, chief\\nexecutive of computer retailer CompUSA Inc.  \\n<p>\\n   PC makers are caught in a bind they helped create: They substantially\\nincreased production to catch up with unfilled orders, despite a slowdown in\\ndemand. U.S. shipments of PCs are expected to grow only 12% this year, compared\\nwith 27% last year, according to International Data Corp. Yet some major\\nplayers are producing 50% more machines than a year ago.  \\n<p>\\n   Though some popular models, particularly portables, remain in short supply,\\nother PCs are piling up at the warehouses of big makers. The industry already\\nhas record levels of inventory, says analyst Don Young of Lehman Brothers Inc.\\nCompaq Computer Corp.\\'s inventory soared to equal 90% of its revenue in the\\nsecond quarter, up from 63% a quarter earlier. And International Business\\nMachines Corp. said yesterday that it had to cut prices on $480 million of\\nunsold PCs over the past few months, and still has $120 million of them to get\\nrid of.  \\n<p>\\n   Once the order backlog disappears, that bloated inventory will pressure PC\\nmakers to cut prices -- perhaps, for some companies, to below what it cost to\\nmake the machines. \"Cost doesn\\'t become relevant if you have too much product\\nand you have to blow out inventory,\" Mr. Young says.  \\n<p>\\n   Merisel Inc., a major computer distributor, already sees signs that PC\\nmakers are eager to get machines out the door by offering better prices and\\nfaster delivery, says its president, John Connors.  \\n<p>\\n   Bigger makers are betting that they can increase their market share at the\\nexpense of rivals. Smaller, weaker brands could be trapped in the crossfire. In\\na price war, they would be forced to reduce prices below those of big-name\\nbrands, and some might go out of business.  \\n<p>\\n   Some optimists hope that PC makers can avoid an all-out price war. Big\\nmakers can\\'t afford to act irrationally because profit margins are much thinner\\nthan they were a few years ago, says Richard Zwetchkenbaum of IDC. If demand\\nperks up, stoked by a first round of smaller price cuts, PC makers may be able\\nto sidestep a wrist-slitting battle.  \\n<p>\\n   \"I don\\'t see the fuel for a price war,\" says Mal Ransom, vice president for\\nmarketing at PC maker Packard Bell Electronics Inc.  \\n<p>\\n   PC makers have tried to keep prices up in the past few years by offering\\never beefier machines -- more memory, faster chips, extra features -- for the\\nsame price. But many believe that the industry is running out of new bells and\\nwhistles. Some makers, such as Gateway 2000, already equip most models with\\nCD-ROM drives, the hottest new accessory. Compaq makes its consumer PCs with\\nbuilt-in modems and phone-answering systems. The next generation of features,\\nsuch as video conferencing, isn\\'t yet cheap enough to become standard fare.\\nCutting prices may be the only weapon left.  \\n<p>\\n   Compaq may be the company to watch. It set off the last price war two years\\nago with new low-cost PCs. It also revved up production 50% this year, despite\\nslowing industry growth. Its low costs and lush gross profit margins -- about\\n27% compared with high teens to low 20s at competitors -- would let it cut\\nprices at rivals\\' expense.  \\n<p>\\n   \"I wouldn\\'t be surprised if Compaq fires a shot across the bow of IBM,\"\\ngiven the smaller company\\'s vow to overtake the biggest PC maker, says analyst\\nJohn McCarthy of Forrester Research Inc.  \\n<p>\\n   IBM plans to revamp its entire line this fall, complete with new names. That\\ncould lead it to cut prices to clean out inventory and stop a slide in its\\nmarket share. Apple Computer Inc. faces challenges as well. Sales of its new\\nMacintosh models based on the PowerPC chip aren\\'t meeting expectations, which\\ncould prompt discounting.  \\n<p>\\n   Other pressures on PC prices go to the foundation of the industry. Intel\\nCorp., which dominates the microprocessor market, faces growing competition\\nfrom makers of Intel-like chips. Compaq and AST Research Inc. have said they\\nwill use the cheaper chips in some models. More makers are sure to follow.  \\n<p>\\n   In response, Intel is expected to cut prices by up to half by year\\'s end.\\nThat could send computer prices down another 12%, given that the microprocessor\\naccounts for about a quarter of a PC\\'s cost, says Kimball Brown, an analyst at\\nDataquest Inc.  \\n<p>\\n   Intel plans to push its top-of-the-line Pentium into the mainstream through\\nits price cuts. PCs based on the 486 chip -- considered the cutting edge a\\nlittle over a year ago -- will become the new bargain machines. But Intel\\'s\\nstrategy could backfire if customers see no need for Pentium PCs and stick with\\n486s.  \\n<p>\\n   The pricing pressures will also squeeze the already crowded ranks of\\nwholesalers and retailers, which in turn may resort to some extra price-cutting\\nof their own. Sensing the oversupply, PC makers have signed up ever more\\nwholesalers to push out product. Computer \"superstores,\" once a novelty, have\\nmultiplied so that half a dozen CompUSAs or Computer Cities battle for\\ncustomers in many areas.  \\n<p>\\n   In such a cutthroat market, \"nobody wins,\" says Mr. Connors of wholesaler\\nMerisel. Except the customer.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0003 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0204 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2127 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220002 </ACCESN>\\n<GV> G/AGN G/FDL G/HUD G/IGV G/LOC G/TRE </GV>\\n<SB> N/BON N/COB N/FIN N/ICM N/MOR N/MUN N/REG </SB>\\n<RE> R/FE R/NME R/NY R/NYC R/PRM R/SK R/TN R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Credit Markets:  Bond Prices Edge Higher as Trading Is Sluggish \\n     Following Greenspan\\'s Hint of Rate Increases  ----  By Abby Schultz \\n    and Lauren Young  Special to The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   NEW YORK -- The bond market was sluggish yesterday, still dazed a day after\\nFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan\\'s reminder that interest rates could\\nrise again.  \\n<p>\\n   On Wednesday, Mr. Greenspan sent prices plummeting when, in testimony before\\nCongress, he alluded to the possibility of further interest-rate increases.\\nAlthough yesterday\\'s price action didn\\'t mirror Wednesday\\'s severe downdraft,\\ntraders and analysts said the Fed chairman\\'s comments continued to dominate\\nactivity, making participants jumpy.  \\n<p>\\n   Late yesterday, the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up less\\nthan 1/8 point, or $1.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face value, to 84 25/32. Its\\nyield stood at 7.54%, virtually unchanged from Wednesday. Meanwhile the price\\nof the 10-year note dropped less than 1/8 point to 99 30/32 to yield 7.24%, up\\nfrom 7.23%.  \\n<p>\\n   In bond issuance, the city of Seoul sold $300 million of 10-year notes, the\\nfirst South Korean debt issue since the death of North Korean leader Kim Il\\nSung earlier this month. The Federal Home Loan Bank, meanwhile, entered the\\ninternational arena with the third global issue from a U.S. federal agency this\\nsummer. And controversy surrounded another agency issue: this week\\'s $500\\nmillion deal for Tennessee Valley Authority.  \\n<p>\\n   In his semiannual report to Congress on Wednesday, the Fed chairman\\ndelivered an unexpectedly strong statement about the likelihood of another rate\\nincrease. That squelched what had been a week-long market rally and prompted\\ninvestors and traders to scramble to the sidelines. Mr. Greenspan is scheduled\\nto continue his testimony today before a House banking subcommittee. \"We\\'ve\\nbeen trying to run our portfolios defensively, thinking that the Fed isn\\'t\\ndone, and we expect rates to rise further,\" said David Schroeder, a portfolio\\nmanager at Benham Group. \"It seems like Greenspan left the door wide open\" for\\nfurther tightening.  \\n<p>\\n   Also damping enthusiasm is $97 billion in fresh supply that is expected to\\nhit the Treasury market before the Fed\\'s next Federal Open Market Committee\\nmeeting on Aug. 16. It\\'s at that meeting that most market watchers believe the\\nFed will again raise interest rates, unless economic data strongly suggest the\\nFed action would be unwarranted.  \\n<p>\\n   The market also lost a little ground yesterday on comments by Laura Tyson,\\nchairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Speaking in Washington, D.C.,\\nshe reiterated the Clinton administration\\'s growth forecast, which calls for a\\n1/4 percentage point rise in interest rates in the remainder of this year.\\nOrdinarily, such words wouldn\\'t have much impact on bond prices. But they\\ngained attention because of the bond market\\'s current state of unease, traders\\nsaid.  \\n<p>\\n   Despite the attention that was being paid over the last week to signs of\\nslowing economic growth, some bond market participants question whether the\\nrally over the last week, which had cut the yield on the 30-year bond by a\\nquarter of a percentage point, could have been sustained anyway. Most retail\\ninvestors, such as mutual-fund managers, have remained defensive through the\\nupswing in prices, preferring to stay firmly in short-term securities or stay\\nclear of the market altogether until prices retreat to lower levels.  \\n<p>\\n   The rally instead was mostly driven by dealers who were covering short\\npositions, asserted Robert McCorckle, a salesman at Seattle Northwest\\nSecurities Inc. In a short sale, a dealer sells a borrowed security in hopes of\\nreplacing it at a later date at a lower price. Dealers \"cover shorts\" when they\\nbuy back these borrowed securities.  \\n<p>\\n   Retail investors remain reluctant to dive into the market. Mr. Greenspan\\'s\\ntestimony, in which he said it was an \"open question\" whether the Fed\\'s actions\\nso far this year have been enough to squash inflationary pressures, simply\\nconfirmed their unease with the previous market levels. Many market watchers\\nbelieve that means the Fed could boost rates again, with most anticipating such\\na move at the Aug. 16 FOMC meeting.  \\n<p>\\n   Most fund managers plan to deal with the uncertainty by keeping the\\ndurations in their portfolios short. A portfolio of shorter-term securities\\nallows a manager flexibility. Duration is the average length of time it takes\\nto receive the present value of the interest and principal of a bond or entire\\nportfolio.  \\n<p>\\n   \"Most institutional investors at this point are still operating with higher\\ncash levels than normal and shorter durations,\" said Mr. Schroeder of Benham.\\n\"The supply will weigh on prices as we move forward.\"  \\n<p>\\n   But investors are likely to turn bullish on the bond market once they have\\nproof that the Fed can keep inflation below the peak of the last strong\\nbusiness cycle, said analysts. At that point -- in early 1991 -- inflation\\nreached 5.5% on a year-over-year basis, said Cary Leahey, senior financial\\nmarket economist at Lehman Brothers Inc.  \\n<p>\\n   \"If the market starts thinking Greenspan will draw the line in the sand at\\nsome rate in the 3% range -- that would be a considerable improvement over the\\nlast business cycle,\" he said.  \\n<p>\\n   But Mr. Leahey said Mr. Greenspan doesn\\'t need to tighten on Aug. 16 if the\\nmajor economic indicators preceding the meeting confirm that the economy has\\nslowed down enough. Mr. Leahey notes that bond market participants have reacted\\nfar more strongly to the Fed tightenings executed so far this year than in any\\nof six previous periods of monetary tightening. That means the economy could\\nstart to feel the effects of the Fed\\'s actions far sooner.  \\n<p>\\n   Meanwhile, the Treasury sold 52-week bills yesterday. Here are the results\\nof the sale:  \\n<p>\\n   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face\\nvalue. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor\\'s return while lower bidding\\nwidens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the\\ncoupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.  \\n<p>\\n   The bills are dated July 28 and mature July 27, 1995.  \\n<p>\\n   Seoul sold $300 million of 7.875% coupon 10-year notes at 99.856 to yield\\n7.91% after postponing the issue for several weeks following the death of Kim\\nIl Sung, president of North Korea. The notes carry a put option that allows\\ninvestors to sell back the bonds to the issuer at par, or face value, in five\\nyears.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Kim\\'s death may have actually helped fan investor interest in Seoul\\'s\\noffering, which was boosted in size to $300 million from $200 million, said\\nBradley Jack, head of debt capital markets for lead manager Lehman Brothers\\nInc. The investing community feels that there\\'s a possibility for economic and\\npolitical reform in North Korea, Mr. Jack explained.  \\n<p>\\n   Underwriters said the issue found strong placement among U.S. insurance\\ncompanies and fund managers. About 30% of the issue was placed internationally,\\nthey added. They said the issue had been planned for about a year. The offering\\nhit the market shortly after an announcement by the White House that U.S. and\\nNorth Korean negotiators agreed \"in principle\" on a date to resume talks\\nregarding the communist country\\'s nuclear buildup.  \\n<p>\\n   But several fund managers said they passed on Seoul\\'s bond issue because\\nthey are not yet comfortable with the region\\'s immediate outlook. \"You\\'ve got\\nto take a calculated risk in buying Korean paper,\" said Glen Baptist, a\\ndirector of corporate bond research at Prudential Investment Advisors.  \\n<p>\\n   Seoul\\'s issue is rated single-A-1 by Moody\\'s Investors Service Inc. and\\nsingleA-plus by Standard & Poor\\'s Ratings Group.  \\n<p>\\n   Meanwhile in the secondary market, prices on junk bonds ended flat to down\\n1/8 point in light trading. Spreads on investment-grade debt were unchanged in\\nquiet trading as prices rose slightly following Treasurys.  \\n<p>\\n   In the new-issue market, the Federal Home Loan Bank, which provides low-cost\\nloans to home-mortgage lenders through its member banks, sold $1 billion of\\ntwo-year global bonds with a 6.125% coupon at 99.786 to yield 6.24%. The issue\\nwas priced at a spread of 0.10 percentage point above two-year, when-issued\\nTreasurys.  \\n<p>\\n   Prices of municipal bonds were swept lower yesterday, depressed by the\\nprevious day\\'s tidal wave of supply.  \\n<p>\\n   In thin municipal secondary trading, the Burke County, Ga., Development\\nAuthority\\'s 6.375% bonds of 2024 ended 1/4 lower at 98 1/2, to yield 6.48%.  \\n<p>\\n   Yesterday was the first full day of trading since $4 billion of California\\nrevenue anticipation warrants hit the muni market. California\\'s enhanced, or\\nbank-guaranteed, Series C RAWs traded at yields as high as 5.00%, traders said,\\ncompared with a yield of about 4.91% when they were priced Wednesday. But the\\nsecurities recovered, with yields late in the day at around 4.95%.  \\n<p>\\n   Weakness in short-term Treasurys helped pull down the securities, said\\ntraders, adding that the direction of Treasurys would probably dictate the\\nRAWs\\' fate in the near future.  \\n<p>\\n   Meanwhile, New York City\\'s $791 million of general obligation bonds weren\\'t\\nfreed to trade yesterday following their sale on Wednesday, but may be today.\\nDemand in the secondary market for the paper, which after a repricing yields\\nfrom 4.50% in 1996 to 6.45% in 2010, is expected to be good, with a number of\\nolder New York City secondary bonds being offered at about the same level.  \\n<p>\\n   Prices of mortgage securities ended slightly lower. But discount\\npass-throughs fell more sharply, with the Government National Mortgage\\nAssociation 6.5% issue losing 9/32 to 85 20/32.  \\n<p>\\n   Many investors remained absent, leaving dealers to dominate the market and\\nkeeping volume low, said traders. However, mortgages are maintaining their\\nvalue in relation to Treasurys, as fresh pass-through supply remains limited.\\nSales of securities to dealers by mortgage bankers has been subdued, suggesting\\nsupply will remain low, traders said.  \\n<p>\\n   Julie Creswell contributed to this article.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0004 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0204 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2359 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220003 </ACCESN>\\n<SB> N/NDX N/STK N/WSR </SB>\\n<RE> R/ASA R/CH R/CN R/EU R/FE R/FR R/GE R/HK R/ITA R/JA R/LTM R/MX R/MY \\n    R/NL R/NME R/NZ R/PRM R/RP R/SCA R/SK R/SN R/SW R/SZ R/TW R/UK R/US \\n    R/WEU </RE>\\n<HL> World Markets:  Tokyo Shares Stumble on Currency, Rate Moves;  Stocks \\n    Rebound in London but Sink in Frankfurt  ----  A Wall Street Journal \\n    News Roundup </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   Tokyo stocks dropped broadly Thursday in extremely thin trading in the wake\\nof yen-dollar movements in currency dealings and U.S. financial markets\\'\\nweakness Wednesday on signals that interest rates could rise. Many other Asian\\nand Pacific bourses also slumped.  \\n<p>\\n   But in London, a late rally wiped out early losses and left shares higher.\\nIn Frankfurt, though, equities tumbled 1.2% on German and U.S. rate scenarios. \\n\\n<p>\\n   World-wide, stock prices fell in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock\\nIndex was at 115.91, down 0.85, reflecting lower European and Asia/Pacific\\nmarkets and higher markets in the Americas.  \\n<p>\\n   Computer stocks (with IBM) were the top gainers in the Dow Jones World\\nIndustry Groups, closing at 97.18, up 2.89, or 3.1%, with International\\nBusiness Machines of the U.S. posting a 11.6% gain in its local currency. Drug\\nretailers\\' stocks trailed at 116.84, down 2.56, or 2.1%, with Boots of Britain\\nsliding 2.5% in local currency.  \\n<p>\\n   In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-stock index, which rose 5.60 points Wednesday,\\nretreated 157.84 to 20622.92. On Friday, the Nikkei fell 61.51 points to close\\nthe morning session at 20561.41. Thursday\\'s firstsection volume was estimated\\nat a mere 250 million shares, off sharply from a thin 310 million shares a day\\nearlier. Losers outnumbered gainers, 771-249. The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or\\nTopix, of all first-section issues, which edged up 1.19 points Wednesday, fell\\n13.51 to 1651.98.  \\n<p>\\n   Most investors sat back, analyzing the yen-dollar exchange rate and the\\neffects of yen strength on Japanese corporate earnings. Neither selling nor\\nbuying was heavy, but a limited amount of selling, notably by dealers and\\nforeign investors, sent the Nikkei down, with the thin turnover exaggerating\\nthe downward trend. Public funds did some buying but this was offset by\\nbrokers\\' selling; as the end of the month nears, dealers are adjusting\\npositions by taking profits.  \\n<p>\\n   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index climbed 17.9\\npoints to 3095.1, near the intraday high of 3097.5; the index rebounded from\\nthe session low of 3061.1. The FT 30-stock index rose 10.9 points to 2402.5.\\nVolume was 607.3 million shares, compared with 679.7 million shares a day\\nearlier.  \\n<p>\\n   The German Bundesbank\\'s decision to leave its official interest rates\\nunchanged had little effect on London stocks, as the central bank hadn\\'t been\\nexpected to reduce rates yet, but with that question out of the way, buyers\\nemerged in the British bourse. The late turnaround came as futures rebounded\\nand market makers, short of stock, scrambled for shares, pushing the FT 100\\nindex up 24.1 points in the last two hours of trading. But volume moderated\\nwhen European institutions that had recently returned to the London equities\\nmarket backed off as the 100-stock barometer again approached 3100.  \\n<p>\\n   In Frankfurt, the DAX 30-stock index lost 25.35 points to 2113.30, after\\nopening weakly and moving within a range of less than nine points. In light\\ndealings, the bourse\\'s sharp drop began after the U.S. Federal Reserve chief on\\nWednesday indicated another increase in interest rates might be needed to damp\\ninflation. Most Frankfurt investors were sidelined ahead of the Bundesbank\\'s\\nrate announcement, which came after the market closed.  \\n<p>\\n   In Paris, stocks fought back from a 1% intraday loss to end with small\\ngains, overcoming profit-taking pressure and the German central bank\\'s decision\\nagainst tinkering with interest rates. Stocks\\' late recovery coincided with a\\nrebound in the French government bond market, which in turn was following\\nGerman bond futures.  \\n<p>\\n   In Amsterdam, shares rose as a late flurry of activity followed market\\ndisappointment about the German central bank\\'s holding firm on rates. In Milan,\\nthe market ended higher after a late rally, as investors switched their\\nattention from German rates to Italy\\'s improving fundamentals and less on\\nrecent political strife in its new government.  \\n<p>\\n   In Stockholm, ending a 10-session winning streak, stocks fell as rising\\nSwedish interest rates sparked profit-taking, though a late buying wave helped\\nrecoup much of the day\\'s losses. In Zurich, prices finished higher in choppy\\ndealings after a late rally in blue chips reversed early losses;\\ndollar-sensitive issues such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals posted the\\nstrongest gains, following a modest recovery by the U.S. currency.  \\n<p>\\n   In Mexico City, stocks jumped almost 1%, rebounding for the first time in\\nfive sessions on expectations of improved earnings by the phone monopoly\\nTelefonos de Mexico, the market\\'s bellwether. Shares recovered from early\\ndeclines linked to worries about higher U.S. interest rates.  \\n<p>\\n   In Sydney, shares tumbled 1.4% in reaction to declines a day earlier on\\noverseas markets, weakness in the Australian bond market, a drop in stock-index\\nfutures, a resurgence of fears about rising inflation and speculation about\\nhigher U.S. interest rates. The banking sector was hit hardest, sinking 2.3%,\\nand gold shares fell 1.1%.  \\n<p>\\n   In Hong Kong, stocks lost ground to continued profit-taking, which began the\\nprevious day following the past week\\'s mostly stronger performance, though a\\nbounce late in the session helped prices move up a bit from the day\\'s lows,\\nwhen foreign investors bought bargains.  \\n<p>\\n   In Singapore, following an eight-session rising trend, equities slumped 1%,\\nas sellers emerged and buyers scurried back to the sidelines following\\nWednesday\\'s drops in U.S. stock and bond markets on expected rate increases. In\\nKuala Lumpur, shares dived 1.3% on anxiety about a rise in U.S. interest rates.\\nIn Seoul, prices edged lower for the sixth straight session, amid continued\\njitters about the balance of market supply and demand; furthermore, sentiment\\nwas hurt by the South Korean central bank\\'s plan to recall special loans made\\nto some blue-chip firms.  \\n<p>\\n   But in Taipei, share prices vaulted 1.6% higher on bullish export and\\nindustrialproduction data and rumors that the Taiwan central bank won\\'t pursue\\na significantly tighter monetary policy. In Manila, stocks fell in light volume\\non continued profit-taking, as investors awaited secondquarter corporate\\nearnings results. In Wellington, shares finished solidly lower in unusually\\nactive trading attributed to portfolio shuffling by an institutional investor.\\nIn Bangkok, following four gaining sessions in a row, stocks sank 1.6%;\\ndeclines were broadly based, on fears that the U.S. may boost rates.  \\n<p>\\n   In China, the two domestic stock markets\\' plunge accelerated on sparse\\nvolume, as a crackdown on bank lending squeezes company earnings, an inflation\\nfight inhibits firms from raising prices, and small investors seek safer\\ninvestments. Shenzhen shares slid to a record low and Shanghai Class A shares\\nplummeted 3.5% to their lowest point since early 1993. The Shanghai market is\\n77% off its high, with most of the drop coming in the past three months.

And Mr. Zimmerman\\'s observations merit special\\nattention because his company, like many others, is reinventing itself to\\nremain competitive as new markets beckon and old ones mature.  \\n<p>\\n   Ford is doing so by creating five \"vehicle program centers,\" each\\nresponsible globally for specific product types, such as small\\nfront-wheel-drive cars or \"personal use trucks.\" This should standardize major\\nparts used around the world, while allowing local variations of basically\\nsimilar final products. Not incidentally, the plan eventually could cut\\nexpenses by $2 billion to $3 billion annually.  \\n<p>\\n   Beyond cost containment, a changing global perspective underlies this effort\\nto put more Fords in everyone\\'s future. For one thing, Mr. Zimmerman says,\\nnation states are no longer the main markets. They are being replaced by\\nregional trading areas, which means production and distribution within each\\narea must be reorganized -- \"a development which argues for a more global\\napproach\" all by itself, he says. The European Union and the North American\\nFree Trade Area are obvious ones, and both will likely add new members before\\nlong.  \\n<p>\\n   Beyond that, Mr. Zimmerman sees two regions as particularly critical. \"The\\nreal growth will come in Asia and Latin America,\" he says, not in the \"mature\\nmarkets\" of Europe, the U.S. and Canada. That\\'s because Asian and Latin\\ngovernments are choosing reform that \"unleashes their real potential,\" he says.\\n \\n<p>\\n   But where in a given region should the company put its chips? Mr. Zimmerman\\napproaches this by asking a few basic questions:  \\n<p>\\n   -- Is there a commitment to long-lived economic reform, and therefore little\\nchance that abrupt policy changes will wipe out an investment\\'s strategic\\nvalue? Like others, Ford wants stability.  \\n<p>\\n   -- Is the regulatory system predictable? Business executives don\\'t like\\nconstant rule changes affecting foreign investment, exchange controls or\\ncontract law.  \\n<p>\\n   -- Does the country manage its own affairs with reasonable skill,\\nmaintaining the value of its currency and preserving political stability? Once\\nagain, the objective is to avoid harsh surprises once big sums are committed.  \\n<p>\\n   With these answered, a company can set priorities, as none can afford to\\ninvest in every country promising reform and growth. In Ford\\'s view, South\\nKorea isn\\'t particularly appealing just now: It talks a good reform game but\\nkeeps many obstacles to foreign investment in general and the auto industry in\\nparticular. Buy a foreign car, for example, and you\\'re almost certain to face a\\ntax audit.  \\n<p>\\n   China is expanding so rapidly that it\\'s nearly impossible to stay away,\\ndespite the vagaries of its regulatory regime. And for an emerging nation like\\nVietnam, it may be too early to tell, though a company must assess the risks of\\nstaying out, as well as those of going in.  \\n<p>\\n   The company\\'s Asian emphasis includes India, a nation with a stifling\\nbureaucracy, but which has launched far-reaching reforms. Latin nations further\\ndown the reform road seem to rank higher. Russia and the rest of the former\\nSoviet Union don\\'t yet rate high at Ford.  \\n<p>\\n   Like others in the auto business, Mr. Zimmerman gets angry about Japanese\\nprotectionism and thinks Japan must buy more foreign goods over time, including\\nFords. Otherwise, an increasingly exasperated world will retaliate, and markets\\nwill be lost. Patience with Japan\\'s policies \"is running out,\" he says.  \\n<p>\\n   Still, the former academic and White House economist doesn\\'t dismiss Japan\\nas a force in the world economy. The strong yen and economic pressures may\\nforce its industry to regroup, but \"Japan will remain tough.\"  \\n<p>\\n   But so will Ford. All any company really has are \"people and processes,\" Mr.\\nZimmerman says, for technology flows across borders freely and raw material\\nsources are less crucial than in earlier days. By reorganizing its assets, Ford\\nhopes to meet this tougher global competition and -- whenever possible -- beat\\nit.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0006 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0205 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2350 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220005 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> PPG </CO>\\n<IN> I/IDD </IN>\\n<SB> N/ERN </SB>\\n<MS> M/IDU </MS>\\n<RE> R/NME R/PA R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Business Brief -- PPG Industries Inc.:  Profit Fell in 2nd Quarter \\n     By 9.4%, Reflecting a Charge </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   PPG Industries Inc.\\'s profit fell 9.4% in the second quarter, reflecting a\\none-time charge, but the company said it is \"on its way to record earnings for\\nall of 1994.\"  \\n<p>\\n   In the quarter, the Pittsburgh maker of glass, coatings and chemicals earned\\n$96.2 million, or 46 cents a share, after a onetime charge of $51.9 million to\\nwrite down the asset value of its blood-gas sensor operation in La Jolla,\\nCalif.

Proponents say the auctions will\\nusher in a new era of wireless, personal-communications services. The FCC\\nexpects the auctions to raise between $10 billion and $12 billion.  \\n<p>\\n   Small companies may find it easier to get into paging and interactive\\nvideo/data services than wireless phone services because of expected lower\\nauction prices and more modest equipment and operating costs, suggests Henry\\nRiggins, president of Progressive Communications Inc. of Cincinnati. His\\nconcern already holds a wireless cable-TV license in Dayton, Ohio.  \\n<p>\\n   Wireless phones, while potentially the most lucrative, also could be the\\nmost risky service. Broadband, the portion of the radio spectrum reserved for\\nwireless phones, \"has gotten so much play in the press, it\\'s the big kahuna,\"\\nsays Mr. Riggins. But \"the cost of entry is tremendous, and I think there\\'ll be\\na battle royal with the cellular phone people in that business.\" Nevertheless,\\nhe plans to participate in auctions for paging, interactive video and wireless\\nphone services.  \\n<p>\\n   FCC officials say small companies represent 87% of those expected to bid for\\nlicenses for interactive video/data services. Such services will transmit\\ncomputerized shopping, entertainment and banking services to television sets\\nwith a special receiver. Those auctions are set for next Thursday and Friday.  \\n<p>\\n   The auction of radio spectrum for paging services, planned for Monday, is\\nattracting companies of all sizes, including units of cable companies and\\nregional Bell operating companies.  \\n<p>\\n   The hottest round of dealmaking will come this fall when entrepreneurs bid\\nfor the broadband spectrum \"set aside\" for small companies, including those\\nowned by minorities, women and rural telephone companies. American Wireless\\nCommunications Corp., a Washington consortium of 24 small companies, wants to\\nattract national communications companies as partners to bid for and build\\nwireless telephone systems. Those tasks are likely to cost hundreds of millions\\nof dollars.  \\n<p>\\n   The Small Business PCS Association, a coalition of 60 small firms headed by\\nKycom Inc. in Portola Valley, Calif., hopes to build a national \"roaming\"\\nnetwork. New York clients could get calls routed there from a West Coast\\noffice.  \\n<p>\\n   SMALL-BUSINESS GROUPS mull shelving health-reform until next year.  \\n<p>\\n   Despite their support for several health-care reform bills now before\\nCongress, some small-business organizations wonder if they would be better off\\nwithout legislation this year. The National Federation of Independent Business\\nstill believes that an overhaul on its terms would benefit small businesses.\\nBut the group fears congressional Democrats may try to insert provisions\\nharmful to entrepreneurs during final conferences to resolve differences\\nbetween the House and Senate bills. The conferences are expected within the\\nnext few weeks.  \\n<p>\\n   \"The business community is fearful of the endgame,\" says John Motley, the\\nfederation\\'s chief lobbyist. The federation worries that administration backers\\nmight add a \"hard trigger\" during conference sessions. This would force all\\nbusinesses to provide employees with health-care coverage if a significant part\\nof the population lacks coverage by a certain \"trigger\" date. \"I don\\'t think\\nlawmakers would do that. But the business community needs some assurances from\\nthe administration and the leadership, and we aren\\'t getting them,\" Mr. Motley\\nsays.  \\n<p>\\n   The NFIB currently supports Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole\\'s health-reform\\nbill as well as a bill proposed by a group of Senate moderates. Earlier this\\nweek, the Small Business Legislative Council also announced its support for the\\nmoderates\\' bill. \"Right now, our priority is supporting what makes sense and\\nCongress is comfortable with. If we can\\'t get something that makes sense, our\\nsecond choice is to do nothing this year,\" says John Satagaj, the council\\'s\\npresident.  \\n<p>\\n   National Small Business United, another advocacy group, still hasn\\'t\\nendorsed a reform bill. But officials say many members are skeptical about\\nUncle Sam\\'s ability to control costs and may prefer no action this year.  \\n<p>\\n   As wrangling drags on, the chances for health-reform legislation this year\\nhave fallen to less than 50%, says NFIB\\'s Mr. Motley.  \\n<p>\\n   MARYLAND WILL INVEST state funds to start an SBA-backed investment firm.  \\n<p>\\n   A bill recently signed by Gov. William Donald Schaefer allows $10 million of\\nstate funds to be invested in a specialized small-business investment company\\nbacked by the Small Business Administration. (SBA investment companies use\\nfederal money to leverage private investments in high-risk ventures. The\\nspecialized investment companies focus on firms owned by minorities and\\neconomically disadvantaged entrepreneurs.)  \\n<p>\\n   With the new law, Maryland becomes the first state to combine its business\\ninvestment capital with venture funds from the federal government and private\\ninvestors. Congress approved that strategy by amending a law governing SBA\\'s\\ninvestment companies in 1992.  \\n<p>\\n   Because such investment companies must be owned by private investors,\\nMaryland will invest through a company to be formed by Stanley Tucker, director\\nof its Small Business Development Financing Authority. Mr. Tucker hopes to have\\nhis SBA license and begin operating the investment firm by January. The\\nfinancing authority has generated its own operating capital with income from\\ninvestments, interest and fees for several years.  \\n<p>\\n   \"This law will help us take companies to the next level with an equity\\ninvestment, and the state can be there to participate when the real money is\\nbeing made,\" Mr. Tucker says.  \\n<p>\\n   SMALL TALK: State meat-processing associations are urging Congress to permit\\nthe interstate shipment of state-inspected meat products. The groups say small\\nprocessing firms deserve the same right that their Mexican counterparts got\\nunder the North American Free Trade Agreement. . . . Last week, the SBA\\noverturned its 40 year-old \"opinion molder\" rule. The rule had barred news\\noperations, bookstores and movie theaters from receiving the agency\\'s financial\\nhelp.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0008 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0205 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2248 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220007 </ACCESN>\\n<SB> N/FND N/XCH </SB>\\n<RE> R/AG R/BR R/CI R/IL R/LTM R/MX R/NME R/NY R/SM R/US </RE>\\n<HL> CBOE Latin-American Options </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   CHICAGO -- The Chicago Board Options Exchange filed with the Securities and\\nExchange Commission to trade options on the CBOE Latin American Emerging Market\\nIndex.  \\n<p>\\n   The Latin American Index is comprised of nine closed-end funds listed on the\\nNew York Stock Exchange.

Keller  Staff Reporter of The Wall \\n    Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   NEW YORK -- AT&T Corp., powered by strong growth in long-distance revenue\\nand telecommunications-equipment sales, posted a 12% gain in second-quarter net\\nincome on an 8.7% rise in revenue.  \\n<p>\\n   AT&T\\'s results were the company\\'s best quarterly showing since its 1984\\nbreakup, and included better-than-expected numbers from AT&T\\'s computer unit,\\nthe former NCR Corp. The loss-plagued unit turned profitable, and it posted\\nsignificantly higher product sales of 18%. Other huge gainers included\\nphone-equipment arm AT&T Network Systems and financial services.  \\n<p>\\n   For the quarter, profit was $1.13 billion, or 83 cents a share, compared\\nwith $1.01 billion, or 74 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue was $17.73\\nbillion, compared with $16.32 billion.  \\n<p>\\n   For the first half, net was $2.22 billion, or $1.63 a share, compared with a\\nyear-earlier loss of $5.83 billion, or $4.32 a share, which was caused by\\nseveral charges, including those related to accounting changes for retiree\\nhealth and other benefits. Without the charges, net in the 1993 period would\\nhave been $1.94 billion, and the latest results would have been a 14% increase\\nfrom that, AT&T said. Revenue climbed 7% to $34.29 billion from $32.04 billion.\\n \\n<p>\\n   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, AT&T shares rose\\n62.5 cents to $53.75.  \\n<p>\\n   AT&T suggested that even better financial performance will come later this\\nyear. \"We expect stronger performance in the second half,\" said Richard Miller,\\nAT&T\\'s chief financial officer, adding that \"we continue to target annual\\noperational earnings growth of at least 10%, excluding the 1994 impact\" of\\nAT&T\\'s pending merger with cellular giant McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.  \\n<p>\\n   McCaw, however, should give a further kick to AT&T\\'s growth. Yesterday,\\nMcCaw posted its first operating profit since going public in 1987. McCaw\\'s net\\nincome was $137 million, or 65 cents a share, its revenue grew 35% to $682.7\\nmillion, and it added 800,000 new customers, a 32% increase, to 3.31 million\\nsubscribers. \"The train\\'s on the track, and I don\\'t see anything derailing this\\nmerger,\" said Craig McCaw, the company\\'s chairman.  \\n<p>\\n   Meanwhile, AT&T\\'s long-distance revenue rose 5% to $10.34 billion, helped by\\ntraffic growth of 7% in the quarter. Even bigger gains were seen by AT&T\\'s\\nequipment unit. AT&T Network Systems posted a 25% rise in revenue to $2.33\\nbillion from $1.87 billion. The results reflected strong sales to U.S. phone\\ncompanies and double-digit growth in overseas markets for switching and\\ntransmission gear.  \\n<p>\\n   At AT&T\\'s computer unit, formerly called NCR Corp. and now known by the\\nunwieldy handle Global Information Solutions, revenue grew 11% to $2 billion.\\nGIS\\'s sales of computer products and other systems jumped 18% to $1.04 billion.\\n \\n<p>\\n   \"You don\\'t do any better than record revenues and operating margins,\" said\\nJack B. Grubman, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. He noted that \"from a\\nstandpoint of relative rate of change, AT&T is by far doing the best right now\\nof the big three long-distance carriers, and Network Systems is blowing the\\ndoors off its rivals like Northern Telecom Ltd.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Grubman noted that at this time last year, AT&T\\'s long-distance unit\\nposted a 5% increase in traffic volume. Its current growth rate of 7% \"is 40%\\nbetter.\" By contrast, Sprint\\'s 12% growth in the quarter was a 33% improvement\\nand MCI\\'s 14% was 13% better than a year earlier. \"This aircraft carrier is\\njust about turned around,\" he said.  \\n<p>\\n   \"AT&T\\'s showing very good trends\" said Robert B. Morris III, an analyst at\\nGoldman, Sachs & Co. \"With its different units of long distance, equipment,\\ncomputers and financial services, AT&T has a broad exposure to the economy, and\\nit is benefiting from this growth.\"  \\n<p>\\n   In fact, Mr. Morris said, AT&T \"may have underreported by a couple of cents\\nper share to tuck away something for a rainy day.\" Mr. Morris noted that the\\nthird quarter is typically the company\\'s weakest in terms of product sales, and\\nper-share net of 85 cents in the latest quarter might have raised analysts\\'\\nexpectations too high for the rest of the year.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Also helping AT&T\\'s product sales were big gains in its office-phone-systems\\nbusiness, consumer-phone and electronic-chip units. Sales of communications\\nproducts and systems, which include the office-phone switches and residential\\nphones, grew 19% to $943 million from $790 million. Phone rentals, however,\\ndeclined 20% to $242 million. Microelectronics products, including chip sales,\\nadvanced 5.4% to $664 million from $630 million.  \\n<p>\\n   AT&T\\'s financial-services businesses continued to put up big numbers.\\nFinancial services, including AT&T\\'s Universal credit card and leasing arm AT&T\\nCapital Corp., reported revenue growth of 23% to $723 million from $588\\nmillion.  \\n<p>\\n   Now among the nation\\'s three-largest card programs, Universal had 20 million\\ncards outstanding by the end of June, 13.4 million cardholders and receivables\\nof $10 billion, AT&T said.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0011 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0206 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 0001 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220010 </ACCESN>\\n<GV> G/CNG G/IGV G/JAGV G/STD G/TRE </GV>\\n<SB> N/BON N/ECO N/FRX N/GTT N/IMF N/TRD N/UNN </SB>\\n<RE> R/CH R/EU R/FE R/GE R/JA R/NME R/PRM R/US R/WEU </RE>\\n<HL> Economy:  Treasury Official  Plays Down Pull  Of Inflation Fear \\n     ---  Undersecretary Contends  Other Factors Burden  The Dollar \\n    Even More  ----  By Lucinda Harper  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street \\n    Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   WASHINGTON -- The Treasury\\'s top international official tried to quell the\\nidea that fears of future price increases are behind the dollar\\'s unwelcome\\nweakness, and he reiterated the administration\\'s hopes that the currency will\\nstrengthen.  \\n<p>\\n   \"The cause of recovery in the United States and global recovery would be\\nbetter served . . . by a stronger dollar,\" Treasury Undersecretary Lawrence\\nSummers said. \"A decline in the dollar has potentially adverse consequences for\\nconfidence. It has potentially adverse consequences for long-term investment.\\nIt has potentially adverse consequences for the dollar\\'s central role in the\\nmonetary system.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Summers\\'s words, coupled with jawboning by German officials, caused the\\ndollar to rise sharply against the mark and by a lesser amount against the yen.\\nThe dollar\\'s gains calmed the bond market. Stocks rose.  \\n<p>\\n   In contrast to comments earlier this week by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan\\nGreenspan, Mr. Summers told the Senate Banking Committee: \"Of the various\\nfactors that have been relevant to currency fluctuations, I would not assign a\\nhigh weight to inflation expectations.\" Appearing before the same committee on\\nWednesday, Mr. Greenspan described the weak dollar as a sign that inflationary\\nexpectations in financial markets are rising.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Summers blamed the drop in the dollar on improved prospects of recovery\\nin Europe, which have strengthened the German mark, and the concern that the\\nnew government in Japan may not be able to deal with its current-account\\nsurplus. \"The dollar has in fact been stable when you look at its relationship\\nwith the currencies of all major trading partners,\" Mr. Summers added; the U.S.\\ndollar has been particularly strong against the Canadian currency.  \\n<p>\\n   The Treasury official blamed rising credit demands, rather than inflation\\nexpectations, for the increase in long-term bond yields around the world.  \\n<p>\\n   Both Mr. Summers and his boss, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, yesterday\\nvoiced skepticism about a plan floated by an independent commission headed by\\nformer Fed Chairman Paul Volcker that would re-establish a system of tighter\\nexchange-rate bands, with the International Monetary Fund guarding the\\nstability of the system.  \\n<p>\\n   \"In theory it\\'s a good idea. In practice, it\\'s much more difficult than it\\nfirst might appear,\" Mr. Bentsen said at a State Department conference.

Even as OTC\\nshares reach new highs, many fund managers say Jafco still has room to rise.  \\n<p>\\n   Jafco is Japan\\'s only publicly traded venture-capital firm, and the\\ncompany\\'s close links with -- and equity holdings in -- dozens of other OTC\\nfirms make it a valuable stock for many investment managers. They said its\\nrelative weakness -- it has lagged behind the market lately -- enhances its\\nallure.  \\n<p>\\n   \"Over-the-counter funds have to have this stock, it\\'s such a good company,\"\\nsaid Masanao Yoshitake, small-stocks fund manager at Kleinwort Benson\\nInvestment Management Inc. He\\'s wary of the overall market these days, but said\\nJafco should be able to gain 8% in the near term.  \\n<p>\\n   Unlike most overseas venture-capital firms, which back start-up companies\\nthat have some edge in a new technology, Jafco specializes in bringing to\\nmarket established firms that haven\\'t yet issued stock. The company, which is\\npartly owned by Nomura Securities Co., provides consulting, makes loans and\\neventually invests in the clients\\' securities.  \\n<p>\\n   Over the years, Jafco has piled up many small-company stocks that don\\'t\\nappear at full market value on Jafco\\'s books. That\\'s one reason, analysts said,\\nthat they can live with Jafco\\'s price/earnings ratio of 193, about three times\\nthe OTC market average.  \\n<p>\\n   \"It\\'s like owning an investment trust [a type of mutual fund] on the OTC\\nmarket,\" said Rie Ota, a senior analyst at Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd. \"What\\nthey have from their partnerships with other OTC companies gives them a value\\nbeyond their own assets.\" Ms. Ota said Jafco, which closed Thursday at 16,400\\nyen ($166.16) a share, has \"a fair price of 22,000 to 23,000 yen.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Analysts have long made a similar argument justifying high share prices for\\nthe big Japanese banks listed on the first section of the stock exchange. Banks\\nsuch as Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. also own many shares in other companies\\non their exchange -- and have high P/E ratios partly as a result.  \\n<p>\\n   But of the two exchanges, the OTC market holds more appeal for investors.\\nWhile the huge traditional companies on the first section struggle with painful\\nand costly restructurings, the smaller OTC companies are profiting from\\nJapanese deregulation.  \\n<p>\\n   Jafco is also attractive to fund managers for its wide ownership. With close\\nto 3,000 shareholders, Jafco is one of the most widely held stocks in the\\nmarket -- a liquidity that makes its shares easy to trade. Most OTC companies\\nhave fewer than 1,000 shareholders, which makes their shares hard to acquire;\\nbuying Jafco stock is like getting proxy ownership in those companies.  \\n<p>\\n   But even as investor interest has driven Japan\\'s OTC stocks to record levels\\nin recent days, Jafco shares have lagged, falling from a high last month of\\n18,700 yen. That could be a warning that some investors are already taking\\nprofits.  \\n<p>\\n   Or it could simply signal that increasingly sophisticated investors are\\nchasing a broader array of stocks. Craig Chudler, managing director of Thomas\\nNorton Associates Inc., said Jafco\\'s poor showing is a sign that investment\\nmanagers are selling some of their Jafco holdings in order to pick up other OTC\\ncompanies.  \\n<p>\\n   \"It\\'s not a sign of poor health at Jafco,\" Mr. Chudler said. \"It\\'s a sign\\nthat people are starting to go through other companies in the exchange.\"  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0014 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0206 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2028 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220013 </ACCESN>\\n<IN> I/SCR </IN>\\n<GV> G/IGV </GV>\\n<SB> N/PER </SB>\\n<MS> M/FIN </MS>\\n<RE> R/FE R/PRM R/SN </RE>\\n<HL> Goh Keng Swee Quits  As Deputy Chairman  Of Singapore\\'s GSIC </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   SINGAPORE -- Seeking to avoid any potential conflicts of interest, Goh Keng\\nSwee resigned as deputy chairman of Government of Singapore Investment Corp.,\\nor GSIC, one of the Singapore government\\'s two main investment arms.  \\n<p>\\n   Dr. Goh, sometimes described as the architect of modern Singapore\\'s economy,\\nwas a cabinet minister from 1959 to 1985 and a key figure in the government of\\nthen-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and the People\\'s Action Party.

Mr. Ma Thinks So  ---  But \\n    a Bureaucratic Brick Wall  Thwarts Dream to Open  Capitalist Booster \\n    Club  ----  By Joseph Kahn  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   WUHAN, China -- In any other place or time, Ma Shaogang would probably be\\nhis city\\'s favorite son. He\\'s a tireless champion of this central China\\nindustrial hub, which he optimistically compares to America\\'s Chicago, a\\nglad-hander who can\\'t imagine a better place for businessmen to invest.  \\n<p>\\n   Indeed, Mr. Ma dreams of opening a local chamber of commerce. At his\\nchamber, businessmen could exchange their calling cards, make contact with\\nforeigners, and bring China\\'s coastal economic miracle inland to this city on\\nthe Yangtze River, he says.  \\n<p>\\n   In China of the 1990s, however, Mr. Ma, a private entrepreneur, has run\\nsmack up against a bureaucratic brick wall. The local Communist Party doesn\\'t\\nobject to his Jiangnan Department Store or his two sauna and karaoke lounges.\\nBut it can\\'t fathom his idea for a capitalist booster club.  \\n<p>\\n   The problem: Mr. Ma and 30 other local bosses want to open a new chamber,\\nindependent of the national chamber, and limit the membership to entrepreneurs.\\nThe official chamber \"has empty people with empty ideas,\" Mr. Ma says. His\\nchamber would push business interests to officials, not relay government\\nmandates to businessmen.  \\n<p>\\n   \"There\\'s a definite need for an organization of this kind as we develop the\\nmarket economy,\" Mr. Ma says. \"Our members could have a real dialogue with the\\ngovernment. We can let them know when their policies are unacceptable.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Wuhan found that unacceptable. After Mr. Ma\\'s group submitted a petition for\\nthe right to open the chamber, local authorities first proposed that the group\\nwork within the official chamber. When Mr. Ma rejected that idea, they told him\\nhe could open a new chamber, but only if he invited all members of the current\\nchamber, including Communist Party functionaries from state-run enterprises, to\\njoin.  \\n<p>\\n   \"They just put obstacles in our path,\" Mr. Ma says.  \\n<p>\\n   Nonetheless, talking about it raised the interest level among other\\nentrepreneurs. The group also followed all the proper procedures for\\nregistering the chamber, so local officials couldn\\'t find an easy excuse to\\nquash it. As a result, \"the project hasn\\'t died. But we have to persuade local\\nofficials to change their way of thinking,\" he says.  \\n<p>\\n   China watchers have predicted for years that rising prosperity will bring\\nchallenges to the Chinese government as businessmen seek to protect their\\ninterests. In fact, wealthy businessmen often pay homage to China\\'s mandarins\\nin hopes of getting favors in return. Pressure for change has come mostly from\\nunemployed workers, poor peasants and disaffected intellectuals.  \\n<p>\\n   More and more, though, private businessmen realize that the bureaucrats who\\nallowed them to emerge aren\\'t necessarily their allies.  \\n<p>\\n   The output of non-state-owned companies will account for half of China\\'s\\neconomy within a few years, experts predict. The government still treats such\\ncompanies like second-class citizens. Chinese banks heavily favor state-run\\nfirms -- at least one-third of which lose money -- over private businesses.\\nApparatchiks control almost all the companies selected to list on stock markets\\nin China or abroad, leaving private firms limited means to raise money.  \\n<p>\\n   \"I do capitalism and they do socialism,\" Mr. Ma says. \"The whole direction\\nof the economy is toward private business. But they don\\'t want us to become an\\nindependent power.\"  \\n<p>\\n   The Communist Party claims that it can represent people of all interests --\\ncapitalists and communists alike -- under unified leadership. Even in China\\'s\\ngrowing market economy, it has managed to stick to that dogma, in part by\\nsimply keeping quiet in the face of clear contradictions with its ideology.  \\n<p>\\n   So far, the party hasn\\'t allowed a truly independent chamber of commerce. It\\nhas tolerated the formation of interest groups for businessmen, as well as in\\nareas like women\\'s rights and the environment, calling them non-government\\norganizations, or NGOs. But the party keeps tabs on them. Foreign aid groups\\njokingly call them GONGOs, or government-owned non-government organizations.\\nMany have party officials as their leaders.  \\n<p>\\n   \"The party still insists that it have some link,\" says Anita Chan, a scholar\\nat Australian National University who has studied Chinese unions and business\\norganizations. \"But there\\'s growing diversity even within the party. If it\\nkeeps up this way, the party may have to change its name.\"  \\n<p>\\n   The fast-talking Mr. Ma doesn\\'t have the patience to wait for slow change,\\nor for much else. One June day in his office, above his department store in the\\nWuchang section of Wuhan, Mr. Ma barks orders on the phone, holds discussions\\nwith associates, reviews a new real estate deal and chats with a reporter\\nsimultaneously. He sleeps just down the hall from his office in order to save\\ntime coming to work.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Ma, 36 years old, cut his entrepreneurial teeth in the Shenzhen\\nboomtown, near Hong Kong, where in the 1980s regulations couldn\\'t keep up with\\nfreewheeling businessmen. When too many like him discovered Shenzhen, he\\nreturned home to Wuhan with some money, a Hong Kong-born wife, and visions of\\ntransforming this transportation and industry hub into a vibrant trading\\ncenter.  \\n<p>\\n   Wuhan offered some advantages over Shenzhen. It has a population of seven\\nmillion, which Mr. Ma says makes it a \"real market, not just a port city.\"\\nWuhan, he says, also has a history that makes it a candidate to explode\\neconomically.  \\n<p>\\n   \"Just like Shanghai, we had the influence of the British, the French and the\\nJapanese,\" he said, referring to the preWorld War II era in which the foreign\\npowers used Wuhan as an inland trading base on the Yangtze. \"Our people also\\nhave the high cultural level and the familiarity with foreigners. Wuhan will\\nsurely be the next Shanghai.\"  \\n<p>\\n   From his perspective, however, Wuhan\\'s conservative bureaucrats haven\\'t\\ngotten the message. The status of private businessmen remains low, and the\\ngovernment worries only about the needs of Wuhan\\'s staff-heavy state\\nenterprises, he says. His firm, for example, has little chance of winning\\nWuhan\\'s nod to list its shares anytime soon, another dream.  \\n<p>\\n   A chamber would give the private sector more status. Among other things, it\\nwould sponsor an MBA program for young businessmen and organize research of\\nsmall-scale family businesses in Taiwan and Italy, which he calls \"the king and\\nemperor\" of the entrepreneurial world.  \\n<p>\\n   \"Look at the role private businessmen have played in those countries!\" Mr.\\nMa says. \"In our country it could be the same, if the government doesn\\'t\\ninterfere.\"  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0019 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0206 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2221 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220018 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> DWD SB </CO>\\n<IN> I/FIS I/SCR </IN>\\n<SB> N/ERN </SB>\\n<MS> M/FIN </MS>\\n<RE> R/NME R/NY R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Dean Witter Profit Jumps, Salomon Has  Loss, Spotlighting 2nd-Quarter \\n    Trends  ----  By Anita Raghavan  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street \\n    Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   NEW YORK -- Dean Witter, Discover & Co. said second-quarter profit jumped\\n32% to $206.9 million, despite the grueling climate for stocks and bonds.  \\n<p>\\n   But Salomon Inc., which derives a chunk of its profits from big trading bets\\nat its Salomon Brothers Inc. brokerage unit, said it had a loss of $204\\nmillion, or $2.08 a share, in the second quarter, its worst performance ever.\\nSalomon earned $433 million, or $3.75 a share, in the year-ago quarter.  \\n<p>\\n   This year\\'s poor results were due to a bad quarter at the firm\\'s Salomon\\nBrothers subsidiary. The securities unit lost $410 million before taxes,\\nlargely because of a $291 million pretax loss in its client-driven business and\\na $119 million pretax loss in its proprietary trading operations. A year ago,\\nSalomon Brothers earned $783 million before taxes.  \\n<p>\\n   The flip-flop in earnings performance was widely expected because Salomon\\ndisclosed earlier this month that it expected a loss of about $200 million due\\nto poor performance at its securities unit.  \\n<p>\\n   Analysts said the vastly different results at the two firms highlight a\\ntrend in earnings patterns this quarter.  \\n<p>\\n   \"The more retail-oriented firms have done reasonably well and the wholesale\\ninvestment banking firms have had a tougher time,\" said Dean Eberling, a\\nsecurities industry analyst at Prudential Securities Inc.  \\n<p>\\n   Strength in credit-card services combined with a tight rein on costs and a\\nconservatively managed securities operation helped propel earnings growth at\\nDean Witter Discover in the quarter.  \\n<p>\\n   \"We don\\'t take a lot of risk in proprietary trading or proprietary\\ninventories so we did not experience any problems there, and we kept a pretty\\nsharp eye on our costs, which helped,\" said Philip J. Purcell, the firm\\'s\\nchairman and chief executive officer.  \\n<p>\\n   Dean Witter earned $1.21 a share in the second quarter, up from $157.1\\nmillion, or 92 cents a share, a year earlier. Total revenue rose to $1.58\\nbillion in the second quarter, up from $1.42 billion a year earlier.  \\n<p>\\n   Earnings in credit services jumped 48% to a record $129.2 million while\\nprofit in the securities business climbed 11% to $77.7 million.  \\n<p>\\n   \"This was the quarter that showed management was able to produce very strong\\nearnings in a very tough environment,\" said Joan Solotar, a securities analyst\\nat Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc.  \\n<p>\\n   Ms. Solotar said one reason Dean Witter Discover produced robust earnings\\ngrowth is that it is more dependent on asset management fees than other firms.\\nAbout 40% of the firm\\'s revenue comes from asset management, Ms. Solotar said,\\ncompared with about 16% for Merrill Lynch, which is well-known as a retail\\nbrokerage powerhouse.  \\n<p>\\n   Meanwhile, Ms. Solotar says a tougher trading environment and a sharp drop\\nin underwriting volume industrywide hurt Salomon Brothers\\' performance in the\\nsecond quarter.  \\n<p>\\n   Indeed, Salomon said that the losses in the brokerage unit\\'s client-driven\\nbusiness reflect inventory losses and declines in customer trading volume and\\nunderwriting activity.  \\n<p>\\n   Like many securities firms, Salomon carries a huge inventory of stocks and\\nbonds. But as interest rates have risen this year, Salomon has had to mark down\\nthe value of its securities to reflect the decline in bond prices.  \\n<p>\\n   According to people familiar with the firm, Salomon was particularly hard\\nhit in the latest quarter by declines in the value of inventory positions in\\nits mortgage-backed securities business and European fixed-income operations.  \\n<p>\\n   The losses at Salomon would have been far worse had it not been for profit\\nat Phibro, the firm\\'s commodities-trading unit. Phibro, which had been\\nhemorrhaging money until this year, earned $82 million before taxes in the\\nsecond quarter, up from $3 million a year earlier.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0020 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0207 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2108 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220019 </ACCESN>\\n<PAGE> B1          </PAGE>\\n<SB> N/CMY N/EDU </SB>\\n<RE> R/MA R/NME R/US </RE>\\n<HL> We Thought It Over and Decided  Creative Thinking Wasn\\'t for Us \\n     ----  By Steve Stecklow  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   Some of the world\\'s leading experts on thinking are gathered this week at\\nthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.  \\n<p>\\n   Perhaps they should do a little thinking about news releases.  \\n<p>\\n   This newspaper received a \"personel\" invitation to the event -- the Sixth\\nInternational Conference on Thinking -- in a letter and news release replete\\nwith rather, uh, thoughtless errors.  \\n<p>\\n   For instance, former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, who was scheduled\\nto receive an award at the conference, was identified as C. Everett Coop.  \\n<p>\\n   The event, the press release said, features \"world renown\" researchers and\\npractitioners in the \"field of education, business, medicine and technology.\"\\nMajor awards given at a banquet will recognize \"international experts in field\\nof thinking.\"  \\n<p>\\n   The release further explained that a new association, known by the acronym\\n\"ACCTION,\" would be launched at the session. The name, it said, stood for\\n\"Assure Creative Thinking in Our Nation.\"  \\n<p>\\n   \"I know, I know,\" said Gela Sulikashvili, a conference spokesman, when asked\\nabout the news release. \"You know, sometimes people think about things too\\nmuch. There\\'s quite a ways to go between thinking and actions.\"  \\n<p>\\n   He described the release as a \"last-minute production\" and said it was not\\nproofread until it was already in the mail. He also said the acronym was\\ncorrect but the name was wrong. The acronym stands for \"Assure Critical and\\nCreative Thinking in Our Nation.\"  \\n<p>\\n   His boss, Robert Swartz, one of the conference\\'s organizers, was not amused.\\n\"I didn\\'t see it, and I don\\'t know how that happened,\" he said.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Swartz went on to say that the conference, which has attracted about\\n2,000 researchers, educators, psychologists and businesspeople, is a very\\nserious event. Its purpose, he said, is to discuss the latest research into how\\nstudents and workers can learn to think \"more carefully and thoroughly so that\\ntheir judgments are well-founded.\"  \\n<p>\\n   In the meantime, the press office at MIT has some thoughts on the matter.\\nFirst, it had nothing to do with the conference\\'s press material.

Investors typically win awards in only 50% of the cases brought\\nagainst brokerage firms, according to securities lawyers.  \\n<p>\\n   As many as 338,000 investors are seeking redress through the fund, set up as\\npart of an October settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission and\\nstate regulators. Prudential has been accused of misleading investors about the\\nrisks and rewards of $8.15 billion of partnerships sold in the 1980s.  \\n<p>\\n   Initially, Prudential set aside $330 million for the restitution fund; last\\nweek, the big brokerage firm set aside an additional $305 million in reserves\\nto cover legal costs from partnership claims.  \\n<p>\\n   Prudential says the results show that the firm is trying hard to be fair to\\naggrieved customers. But the high percentage of awards also reflects\\nPrudential\\'s difficulty in denying some claims. This is because some former\\nPrudential brokers can\\'t be located or won\\'t cooperate, people familiar with\\nthe matter said.  \\n<p>\\n   The report says Prudential has made full or partial awards to 37,493, or\\n75%, of the 50,063 claims that have been decided on the merits. Of those\\nawards, almost 18,000 have been full payments, and more than 19,000 have been\\npartial payments, the report says. The remaining claims have been rejected for\\na variety of reasons.  \\n<p>\\n   Prudential already has paid out a total of $142.6 million through the\\nreparations fund, the report said. And many investors are processing the claims\\nwithout using a lawyer, saving legal fees, according to Joel Brenner of Storch\\n& Brenner, the Washington law firm for the claims administrator.  \\n<p>\\n   Investors tapping the fund are eligible to recover interest, calculated at\\nthe annualized Treasury-bill rate during the time of the investment. The rate\\napplied since Jan. 1 has been 4.51%, the report said.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0022 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0207 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 1706 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220021 </ACCESN>\\n<SB> N/ECO N/EMI N/LAB </SB>\\n<RE> R/NME R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Initial Jobless Claims Rise </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   WASHINGTON -- Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 27,000\\nlast week to 392,000 from a revised 365,000 the previous week, the Labor\\nDepartment said.  \\n<p>\\n   The four-week average of new claims rose to 363,500 from a revised 353,500\\nthe previous week.

Frisby  Staff Reporter \\n    of The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   WASHINGTON -- The Democratic National Committee recruited two lobbyists for\\nregional telephone companies to be official speakers at a conference that\\nfeatured top Clinton administration policymakers and lawmakers.  \\n<p>\\n   The participation of the two telecommunications lobbyists, Peter Knight and\\nRoy Neel, was unusual, particularly because President Clinton has said he\\nwanted to minimize the influence of Washington lobbyists. It also increased\\nconcerns among competitors of the regional Bell companies represented by the\\nlobbyists that the administration has taken the Bells\\' side in the battles over\\nnew telecommunications law.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Knight, who represents Bell Atlantic Corp., and Mr. Neel, president of\\nthe U.S. Telephone Association, joined Gregory Simon, Vice President Al Gore\\'s\\nchief domestic policy adviser, on a panel dealing with \"Opportunities in the\\nInformation Highway.\" Mr. Knight and Mr. Neel are both former top members of\\nMr. Gore\\'s staff. Also on the panel were David Moulton, an aide to Rep. Edward\\nMarkey (D., Mass.), and Michael Barnsley, founder of Iterated Systems Inc.  \\n<p>\\n   The panel was part of an all-day conference on business issues organized by\\nthe Democratic National Committee for contributors who have donated $5,000 or\\nmore to the party. A host of Clinton policymakers, including Deputy Treasury\\nSecretary Roger Altman and Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, also spoke to the\\ndonors. While bringing together government officials and contributors for\\nspecial briefings and conferences is a staple fund-raising tool used by both\\npolitical parties, private lobbyists don\\'t usually participate as official\\nspeakers or briefers.  \\n<p>\\n   \"It certainly raises questions as to who is making public policy here,\" said\\nJoshua Goldstein of the Center for Responsive Politics. \"Is it people elected\\nthat make policy or the people paid by businesses to influence policy?\"  \\n<p>\\n   The DNC defended bringing in the lobbyists to speak at the conference. \"We\\ntried to find knowledgeable people in the field to offer a range of views,\"\\nsaid Jim Whitney, a spokesman for the committee.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Simon, the Gore aide, said he wasn\\'t uncomfortable appearing on the\\npanel with Messrs. Neel and Knight, even though he once worked for Mr. Neel on\\nthe vice president\\'s staff. (Mr. Neel left Mr. Gore\\'s staff to become a top\\nWhite House aide. Earlier this year, he left that job to become head of the\\nlobbying group that represents the Bells and other local telephone companies.) \\n\\n<p>\\n   The DNC insists it aimed to represent a range of views on its\\ntelecommunications panel. But others, especially representatives of\\nlong-distance carriers, complained that they had no voice on the panel. Indeed,\\nwhen the event was first planned, they raised complaints to party leaders and\\nwere told that Mr. Neel wouldn\\'t participate.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Simon insists that his joint appearance with two representatives of the\\nregional telephone companies doesn\\'t mean that the administration\\'s\\ntelecommunications policy is tipping in their favor. \"I\\'ve always made it clear\\nthat we are looking for a solution that incorporates both sides of the debate,\"\\nhe said.  \\n<p>\\n   But Brian Moir, a Washington telecommunications lawyer, says the panel the\\nDNC presented to their donors was \"mismatched and tilted.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Further, Mr. Moir said the event intensifies the view that the\\nadministration, particularly Mr. Gore, who oversees telecommunications policy,\\nis close to the regional telephone companies. \"The widely held view is that the\\nadministration\\'s utterances are too often interruptible as things that sound\\nlike the agenda of the Bell operating companies,\" says Mr. Moir, who represents\\nlong-distance carriers, manufacturers and big industry telephone users.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Neel, according to a person who attended, took the opportunity of\\nappearing on the panel to continue a war of words with AT&T Corp. At one point,\\nMr. Knight, who was the moderator, asked Mr. Neel, \"Why do you hate AT&T so\\nmuch?\" This attendee, who asked not to be identified, said Mr. Neel responded\\nthat he didn\\'t hate the company, but he accused AT&T of trying to stall\\ntelecommunications legislation on Capitol Hill.  \\n<p>\\n   A spokesman for Mr. Neel said that Mr. Neel had made similar statements\\npreviously. He added that Mr. Neel had consulted the White House counsel\\'s\\noffice to make sure his appearance at the DNC panel was proper. Federal ethics\\nlaws prohibit him from lobbying White House officials directly. Clearly,\\nhowever, the appearance at the DNC panel on Wednesday gave Mr. Neel the\\nopportunity to present his views to Mr. Simon.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0038 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0208 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2341 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220037 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> MAT </CO>\\n<IN> I/ENT I/REC I/TMF </IN>\\n<SB> N/ANL N/ERN N/HIY </SB>\\n<MS> M/CYC </MS>\\n<RE> R/CA R/NME R/PRM R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Business Brief -- Mattel Inc.:  Toy Maker\\'s Earnings Rose  40% in \\n    the Second Quarter </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   Mattel Inc. reported a 40% increase in second-quarter net income to $57.1\\nmillion, or 31 cents a share, from $40.8 million, or 23 cents, in the\\nyear-earlier period.  \\n<p>\\n   Sales for the El Segundo, Calif., toymaker rose 13% to $650 million from\\n$577 million.

Burton  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street \\n    Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   A Baxter International Inc. immunoglobulin product now removed from the\\nmarket probably caused 111 cases of acute hepatitis C in the U.S. and Puerto\\nRico, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.  \\n<p>\\n   Baxter\\'s Gammagard intravenous product, derived from human blood plasma and\\nused to treat immune-system deficiencies, was apparently responsible for the\\nillnesses. The federal health agency also said Baxter\\'s Polygam immunoglobulin\\nproduct \"may\" be to blame for one other case. Both products were withdrawn from\\nthe market in February, and Baxter has since received federal approval to\\nmarket new forms of Gammagard and Polygam treated with a solvent and detergents\\nto purify them.  \\n<p>\\n   In addition, there are at least 50 cases of hepatitis C in foreign countries\\npossibly linked to Gammagard, said William Mutert, vice president of global\\nmarketing at Baxter\\'s Hyland division in Glendale, Calif., which makes the\\nproducts. The products are used in chemotherapy patients, children with AIDS\\nand other patients with suppressed immune systems.  \\n<p>\\n   Deerfield, Ill.-based Baxter said it has been named in one lawsuit related\\nto the immunoglobulin hepatitis cases. Mr. Mutert said the company also is\\nevaluating as many as 50 more possible cases of patients overseas to see if\\nthey may be linked to Gammagard.  \\n<p>\\n   In Baxter\\'s initial statement in February, when the products were withdrawn,\\nit said it had received reports of about 14 patients who might have contracted\\nthe disease; the company stressed at the time that other risk factors were at\\nwork in some of the patients. Mr. Mutert said Baxter and the CDC have been able\\nto eliminate those other risk factors over subsequent months as more cases\\nemerged.  \\n<p>\\n   The CDC yesterday said the \"absence of other risk factors among these\\npatients\" suggested that hepatitis \"was most likely transmitted by\\nadministration of Gammagard.\" The agency said there was \"one possible case\" of\\nhepatitis involving Polygam.  \\n<p>\\n   The federal agency said some 60% of people infected with the illness in turn\\ndevelop chronic hepatitis, which is potentially fatal in some instances. The\\nCDC also noted that the illness \"should be considered potentially infectious\"\\nand recommended infected people not share household articles like razors that\\ncould become contaminated with blood.  \\n<p>\\n   The CDC said it didn\\'t recommend large changes in behavior among people who\\nmay have been infected, largely, it said, \"because testing cannot determine\\ninfectivity.\" However, the agency said in an article in its published weekly\\nreport, that hepatitis C virus \"transmission by sexual contact appears to\\noccur.\"  \\n<p>\\n   The agency said this form of transmission \"is much less efficient\" than the\\ntransmission of other blood-borne sexually transmitted diseases. Thus, the CDC\\nsaid, it doesn\\'t have enough data to recommend changes in current sex practices\\nfor people with one sex partner.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0045 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0209 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2336 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220044 </ACCESN>\\n<IN> I/DRG </IN>\\n<GV> G/FDA G/JUS </GV>\\n<SB> N/LWS </SB>\\n<MS> M/NCY </MS>\\n<RE> R/MD R/NME R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Technology Brief -- Mutual Pharmaceutical Co.:  Guilty Plea Made \\n    on Charges  Of Selling Tainted Drugs </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   Mutual Pharmaceutical Co., a generic drug maker, pleaded guilty to seven\\ncounts of criminal violations involving interstate shipments of adulterated\\nprescription medications and was sentenced to pay a $3.25 million fine.  \\n<p>\\n   The U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland announced the guilty plea.

In 1991, outside the oversight\\nof regulators, AT&T and the seven regional Bell companies held a year of secret\\ntalks aimed at crafting terms for urging the federal court to dissolve the\\ndecree.  \\n<p>\\n   The plan was code-named Acorn, as in the old saying \"Tall oaks from little\\nacorns grow.\" One of the last sessions took place at AT&T headquarters in New\\nYork, in a conference room where stately portraits of past chairmen looked down\\non the negotiators. But the talks collapsed over how soon the Bells should be\\nallowed into the long-distance business, according to people familiar with the\\ndiscussions.  \\n<p>\\n   Frustrated, the Bells set out on a 2 1/2 year effort to plot their own\\nstrategy for getting the consent decree voided. On July 6 came one result: Four\\nBaby Bells filed an unprecedented legal motion demanding an end to the decree,\\nthe core of U.S. telecommunications policy since the 1984 breakup. The Bells\\nsay the decree, based on evidence and market data now two decades old, is\\nantiquated and counterproductive.  \\n<p>\\n   That pits the Bells against AT&T and the rest of the industry. It draws hard\\nbattle lines just when federal authorities must begin making decisions that\\nwill determine the structure of, and ground rules for, the $300 billion\\ntelecommunications business for years to come.  \\n<p>\\n   Even as the Bells begin their court action, Congress is weighing sweeping\\nchanges in telecommunications law, and the Bells are lobbying for relief. To\\nsucceed, they must win on both fronts. At the heart of this fight is whether\\nthe U.S. should tear down the barriers segregating AT&T and the Baby Bells and\\nunleash the seven multibillion-dollar monopolies -- and whether the Bells\\nshould sacrifice monopoly control for more freedom.  \\n<p>\\n   The Bells\\' style is \"to act the way they have traditionally -- take\\nadvantage of their position and engage in anticompetitive behavior,\" says\\nBradley Stillman of the Consumer Federation of America.  \\n<p>\\n   Until now, the government has left most of these matters to one federal\\njudge in Washington. District Judge Harold H. Greene, now age 71, presided over\\nthe antitrust case and played a central role in fashioning the breakup\\nsettlement that took effect on Jan. 1, 1984. Ever since then, he has reigned as\\nthe de facto \"telecom czar,\" holding sway over the Bells far longer than anyone\\nanticipated. Now Judge Greene gets to decide whether to grant their demand that\\nhe abdicate and set them free.  \\n<p>\\n   Yesterday in Washington, Bell lawyers appeared before the judge on an\\nunrelated matter and briefly discussed the decree. While the judge made clear\\nit may be time for change, saying he had been \"saddled\" with the order for 12\\nyears, he also suggested it would be \"unseemly\" to act on the Bells\\' new motion\\nand related pending matters while Congress is weighing the same issues.  \\n<p>\\n   Consumers have much to gain or lose in the clash of telecom titans. The size\\nof their local monthly phone bills, how low long-distance prices go, what kind\\nof newfangled features they can get, how soon they may enter the much-hyped\\ninformation highway -- all could be affected by the Bells\\' assault in court and\\non the Capitol.  \\n<p>\\n   The industry and its shareholders also may see major changes if the Bells\\nget the consent decree lifted. The regional companies would be entirely free to\\noffer long-distance service, acquire one another, invade other Bell markets,\\nmerge with a cable, broadcast or long-distance company -- or perhaps retie the\\napron strings to AT&T. They could resell AT&T services, form consortiums among\\nthemselves or even merge with a big computer maker.  \\n<p>\\n   Four Baby Bells started this fight: Bell Atlantic Corp. of Philadelphia,\\nBellSouth Corp. of Atlanta, Nynex Corp. of New York and Southwestern Bell Corp.\\nof San Antonio. The other three -- U S West Inc. of Denver, Ameritech Corp. of\\nChicago and Pacific Telesis Group of San Francisco -- are pursuing their own\\nlocal deregulation efforts and could join in later.  \\n<p>\\n   For years, the Bells took a low-profile approach to overturning the breakup\\ndecree. They grew less patient after the Acorn talks failed to produce a plan\\nto end the decree even by the year 2000. \"It became clear that AT&T had no\\nintention\" of helping them win a reprieve, one Bell executive says. Impatience\\nturned to urgency after AT&T set plans last year to acquire cellular giant\\nMcCaw Cellular Communications Inc., threatening the Bells\\' local service.  \\n<p>\\n   The Bells contend that the decree must be dismantled because competition and\\nopportunity loom: Cable companies want to invade phone companies\\' turf and vice\\nversa, a raft of new wireless rivals and mergers is at hand, and the\\ninformation highway is opening up. \"Let them come in\" and compete in the local\\nmarket, declares William Ferguson, Nynex\\'s chairman. \"Let\\'s get on with it.\"  \\n<p>\\n   The reality is far less than all that. So far, the local business, though on\\nthe brink of upheaval, hasn\\'t changed all that much. The Bells still control\\n99% of the $80 billion-plus in annual local revenue in their areas. A total of\\n46 states don\\'t allow any competition for basic local phone service, enabling\\nthe Bells to charge long-distance companies $21 billion a year for access to\\nBell customers. As long-distance calling prices fell more than 40% during the\\npast decade, the Bells raised their average basic phone bills more than 30%,\\ndespite paring their own costs considerably.  \\n<p>\\n   While the rest of the industry pushes toward greater competition, the Bells\\nhave barely budged. Most won\\'t let rivals hook up directly to their networks,\\nand last month they won a federal-court lawsuit overturning rules requiring it.\\nThey push regulators to widen the areas in which a call is deemed \"local,\"\\nthereby squeezing out long-distance companies.  \\n<p>\\n   \"Fact is, you can use any one of dozens of carriers to call across the\\ncountry,\" says Mark Rosenblum, an AT&T lawyer. \"But you have no choice when you\\ncall across town for a pizza.\"  \\n<p>\\n   The Consumer Federation of America, a small Washington lobby, has compiled a\\nlitany of alleged Bell abuses. In 1991, Georgia regulators accused BellSouth of\\nthwarting a rival voice-messaging service. In Missouri, Southwestern Bell\\ncharged an annual fee of just $2.25 per telephone pole to cable companies\\nstringing TV wires but $120 a year for the same pole when a cable company\\nwanted to offer alarm-system services in competition with it.  \\n<p>\\n   In 1990, Georgia authorities accused BellSouth of overcharging customers by\\n$180 million; in 1992, the company settled charges in Florida that customers\\npaid $15 million for calls that were never made. Pacific Telesis got nailed in\\n1991 for levying $34 million in bogus late fees over several years. Nynex used\\na subsidiary to sell gear to its phone companies at inflated prices, increasing\\nrates by $120 million.  \\n<p>\\n   At various points, some Baby Bells have been accused, or have settled\\ncharges, of improperly funding lobbying with ratepayer dollars, waging secret\\nletter-writing campaigns on their behalf by employees, paying kickbacks and\\nbribes, and committing sundry other misdeeds.  \\n<p>\\n   Such methods are a simple side effect of monopoly power, Bell foes say,\\nadding that the record could grow worse if the Baby Bells are allowed into new\\nmarkets.  \\n<p>\\n   The old AT&T monopoly started out with government blessings in 1913, when\\nAT&T agreed to shed control of Western Union to focus on the national goal of\\nproviding \"universal service.\" In return, AT&T won a guaranteed but regulated\\nmonopoly. By the 1950s, thanks to the local Bells\\' vast reach, AT&T controlled\\nalmost all U.S. long-distance and local service.  \\n<p>\\n   By 1956, AT&T had settled its first major antitrust case, agreeing to rein\\nin its equipment-making arm. By the late 1960s, AT&T was in antitrust trouble\\nagain. A gnat-sized rival -- today MCI Communications Corp. -- won the right to\\noffer long-distance service to businesses. AT&T ordered its two dozen local\\nsubsidiaries to hinder MCI. They repeatedly delayed giving MCI link-ups that\\nwould let MCI complete calls and undercut AT&T rates. At one point, customers\\nhad to dial a 22-digit access code to use MCI.  \\n<p>\\n   \"We\\'ve been through the abuse of monopoly power,\" says Eugene Eidenberg, an\\nMCI executive vice president. \"The Bells gave us inferior connections and in\\nsome cases sabotaged our lines -- they actually sent people in to pull our\\ncircuits.\"  \\n<p>\\n   The Justice Department filed civil antitrust charges against AT&T in 1974.\\nJudge Greene took on the case in 1978 and pushed it to trial in January 1981.\\nEight months later, in rejecting AT&T\\'s motion to dismiss, he ruled that the\\ngovernment had largely proved that \"the Bell System has violated the antitrust\\nlaws in a number of ways over a lengthy period of time.\"  \\n<p>\\n   By New Year\\'s Eve, AT&T was negotiating final terms of the breakup.  \\n<p>\\n   AT&T, by then an empire of one million employees, agreed to spin off the\\nlocals, recast them into seven regionals and forgo buying back Bell assets. It\\nwould keep the higher-growth businesses of long-distance service and equipment\\nmanufacturing.  \\n<p>\\n   The Bells would hold on to the dull but lucrative local monopoly, known as\\nPOTS (\"plain old telephone service\"). They would be barred from long distance\\nand equipment to ensure that they didn\\'t abuse their monopoly, but they could\\npursue cellular service and new ventures outside the industry.  \\n<p>\\n   On Jan. 5, 1982, AT&T summoned its Bell-company presidents to Basking Ridge,\\nN.J., for a secret meeting to tell them the bad news. They \"were being\\ninformed, not consulted,\" and \"went into shock,\" Peter Tembin and Louis\\nGalambos wrote in \"The Fall of the Bell System.\"  \\n<p>\\n   People who were inside AT&T at the time say the company\\'s overriding focus\\nwas to make sure the newly independent phone companies would be strong enough\\nto stand on their own without the parent\\'s subsidies and supervision. \"This\\nwasn\\'t done by AT&T out of altruism or stupidity,\" recalls Edward Block, then\\nAT&T\\'s corporate communications chief. \"The public-interest issue at the time\\nwas protecting the local monopoly franchises.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Soon afterward, the Bells began believing that they had been done wrong by\\ntheir former parent. They had had no say in shaping terms of the split.  \\n<p>\\n   \"It was apparent immediately that the Bells were at a disadvantage,\" says\\nPhilip Quigley, chairman of Pacific Telesis and an AT&T executive at the time.\\nAssigned to run a new cellular business for the new Bell, he spent his last\\nyear at AT&T working on strategy, while \"looking into the eyes of what I knew\\nwas going to be a competitor that wouldn\\'t have the limitations I had.\" Pacific\\nTelephone & Telegraph, a forerunner of Pacific Telesis, filed some of the first\\nobjections to the restrictions -- in 1982, almost two years before the decree\\nformally took effect.  \\n<p>\\n   The Bells had one hope: The decree couldn\\'t last forever. Such orders\\ntypically lapse after a decade, and the parties hadn\\'t set an end-date; they\\nassumed that the decree would expire much sooner as markets changed. The\\nJustice Department agreed to review the decree every three years. However, the\\nfirst study, in 1987, wasn\\'t completed until 1991, a year after the second one\\nshould have begun. There have been no other reviews.  \\n<p>\\n   In trying to topple the consent decree, the Bells want desperately to enter\\nthe long-distance business -- and AT&T and its rivals are just as desperate to\\nkeep the Bells out. AT&T holds 60% of the $65 billion market, and AT&T, MCI and\\nSprint Corp. together control 85%; several hundred small companies split the\\nrest. None are eager to let in seven new giants.  \\n<p>\\n   The breakup terms allowed the Bells to pursue all sorts of non-telecom\\nventures, and they have tried computer sales, real estate, financial services,\\neven office-furniture rentals -- all without any startling success. But\\nlong-distance plays to their strengths. With their lock on local accounts and\\nexclusive data on the minute-by-minute calling patterns of millions of\\ncustomers, the Bells could tailor discount-pricing packages and undercut\\nlong-distance providers. The Bells say they could slash long-distance rates by\\n50%.  \\n<p>\\n   AT&T counters that the Bells would steer local customers to their own\\nlong-distance units -- anticompetitive behavior that the breakup was designed\\nto prohibit. If price cuts are the goal, AT&T says, the Bells could simply\\nreduce the billions of dollars in access fees that they charge long-distance\\ncompanies for hooking up with local customers. The fees amount to 45% of the\\nprice of a long-distance call.  \\n<p>\\n   The Bells\\' reply: They have cut access fees by $250 million in the past\\nyear, as required under federal rules, while AT&T raised some of its prices to\\nbusinesses by a total of $1.4 billion. And AT&T\\'s latest annual report brags\\nthat higher prices will fuel faster growth this year. Its move was followed\\nalmost in lock step by MCI and Sprint. That suggests the three \"are either\\nperfect competitors or perfect colluders. It\\'s hard to tell the difference,\"\\nsays Eli Noam, director of Columbia University\\'s Tele-Information Institute.  \\n<p>\\n   In addition to the long-distance ban, the consent decree saddles the Bells\\nwith a poky paperwork process that seems outlandish in the fast-moving telecom\\nmarket. Whenever the Baby Bells or AT&T want to exceed the decree\\'s limits,\\nthey must ask Judge Greene for a waiver; other parties can file objections. In\\n10 years, the Bells have filed more than 300 waiver requests, unleashing some\\n7,200 legal briefs. AT&T has sought a waiver of its own just once, though it\\nhas filed arguments against Bell requests at least 20 times.  \\n<p>\\n   Bell executives say that disparity indicates just how much more burdensome\\nthe consent decree is on the regionals. The combative ritual clogs the court\\nand slows approvals, even though Judge Greene has usually granted the Bells\\'\\nrequests. In 1986, he acted on 49 requests, and the Bells had to wait an\\naverage of five months for a ruling. Last year, he acted on just nine waivers\\n-- and the requests had been lying around for an average of four years.  \\n<p>\\n   \"Clearly this isn\\'t a good way to run an industry,\" Columbia\\'s Prof. Noam\\nsays. \"You have a judge who\\'s at retirement age, with two or three clerks just\\nout of law school, supervising the entire telecommunications industry.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Often, the Bells must seek a waiver simply to zap phone calls across\\ncourt-ordered geographic boundaries in their own territories. The decree\\nimposes 164 boundaries that the Bells can\\'t cross when handling a call. Many of\\nthese lines fall within a single state; in Florida, BellSouth has to hand off a\\ncall from Miami to Orlando to a long-distance company.  \\n<p>\\n   BellSouth had hoped to sidestep the restriction for its unregulated cellular\\nbusiness. In 1987, it asked Judge Greene for approval to sell in-Florida\\nlong-distance service provided by outside companies, just as rival McCaw does.\\nThe judge still hasn\\'t ruled.  \\n<p>\\n   Nor does he seem inclined to decide the matter quickly. Earlier this month,\\nhe questioned why the Florida request should go forward, now that the Bells\\nhope to eliminate the decree altogether. BellSouth smacked back, saying the\\njudge is setting up \"an impermissible double-standard\" favoring AT&T while the\\ndecree \"grinds on endlessly for the Bells.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Judge Greene declined to be interviewed for this article.  \\n<p>\\n   The Bells also are miffed that the calling boundaries, aimed at blocking\\nthem from long distance, now apply to such nonphone traffic as data\\ntransmission and TV signals. Bell Atlantic won the legal right to own\\nprogramming last year but must seek a waiver to send or receive satellite\\ntransmissions.  \\n<p>\\n   Pacific Telesis found its hands tied when AT&T and Hughes Communications\\nInc. called on Chevron Corp. They offered satellite-based services to relay\\ncredit-card data from service stations nationwide to company headquarters,\\nbypassing Pacific Telesis\\'s local link. The Baby Bell ultimately lost 80% of\\nthe oil company\\'s business.  \\n<p>\\n   The equipment ban also encumbers the Bells. In 1986, Ameritech sought\\npermission to fund a small California company that makes office networks and\\nwanted to collect royalties on sales to third parties. Six years later, Judge\\nGreene denied the request, saying it violated the manufacturing ban. On appeal,\\nthe case was sent back to him for reconsideration -- and there it sits today.\\nToo late: Ameritech\\'s partnership with the firm has since dissolved.  \\n<p>\\n   Robert Lynch, a senior vice president at Southwestern Bell, calls Judge\\nGreene\\'s role \"pretty scary.\" Mr. Lynch adds: \"If we had a guy who wasn\\'t quite\\nso egotistical and tried to be a more a careful molder of policy, that would be\\none thing.\" But, he asserts, Judge Greene \"not only has the power, he relishes\\nit.\"  \\n<p>\\n   The Bells\\' foes argue that Judge Greene has been fair and is the only force\\nblocking the Bells from running rampant over the consent decree\\'s restrictions.\\n\"Throughout the 10 years that we have been trying to work with them, the Bells\\nhave stonewalled us,\" says Robert Anunziata, president of Teleport\\nCommunications Group, which sells long-distance services to businesses in 15\\nmajor markets.  \\n<p>\\n   In June, when Teleport set plans for a new interstate phone service,\\nSouthwestern Bell refused to cooperate, saying Teleport didn\\'t have proper\\nstate certification. In San Francisco, Hooked Inc. turned to Teleport when\\nPacific Bell repeatedly failed to hook up high-capacity phone lines for it.\\n\"PacBell was obstructionist and put us through the wringer,\" says David Holub,\\npresident of the firm, which offers access to the Internet computer network. A\\nPacific Bell spokesman says there was \"some misunderstanding\" in dealing with\\nHooked.  \\n<p>\\n   LCI International Inc., a long-distance company based in Reston, Va., says\\nit waited more than a year for one Baby Bell to install a new network system.\\nThe Bell blamed an administrative error, but LCI Chairman Brian Thompson sees a\\nhidden motive: The delay made it harder for LCI to offer customers cheaper\\nrates and to reduce the bills it pays to the Bell company. \"It\\'s a hidden\\nagenda no matter how you slice it,\" he says.  \\n<p>\\n   Such suspicions could make it hard for the Bells to break free unless they\\ngive up their chokehold on the local monopoly. If they do, many industry\\nexecutives believe the Bells\\' entry into the long-distance market is all but\\ninevitable. \"They\\'re coming in, no doubt about it,\" says Alex Mandl, chief\\nexecutive of AT&T\\'s long-distance division. \"The question is how soon\" -- and\\nunder what terms.  \\n<p>\\n   Experts say the Bells probably will be forced to let in local rivals much as\\nold Ma Bell had been required to allow new long-distance companies to get equal\\naccess to local customers. Then they would have to agree to permit any rival to\\noffer standard seven-digit phone numbers.  \\n<p>\\n   In Congress, pending bills call on the Bells to open their markets by\\nletting upstart rivals link directly to local networks. The Bells are lobbying\\nhard to weaken provisions that would require them to show \"actual and\\ndemonstrable\" local competition before they could offer long-distance service. \\n\\n<p>\\n   Ultimately a new law could override the Bells\\' effort to end the decree. But\\nit isn\\'t at all clear that legislation can pass Congress this year, much less a\\nbill to the Bells\\' liking. Their biggest problem is in the Senate, and any\\ncompromise carries the threat of including in some way provisions of the\\ndecree. In starting their court assault, the Bells have signaled they see\\nbetter chances of making gains -- without political compromise -- on the legal\\nfront.  \\n<p>\\n   The Baby Bells say their lock on the local market isn\\'t relevant to the\\nmatter of letting them into long distance. They reject suggestions that they\\nmake it easier for new rivals to come in or that they share customer data with\\ncompetitors.  \\n<p>\\n   Even Ameritech, widely viewed as one of the more open-minded Bells, seems\\nadamant. A few months ago, it proposed to Illinois regulators a plan called\\nCustomers First. The company would open the local network for full link-ups by\\nrivals in exchange for permission to handle long-distance calls in its\\nfive-state region.  \\n<p>\\n   Yet Ameritech balks at suggestions that it should have to set up a separate\\nlong-distance company and operate it at arm\\'s length or that it should charge\\nsuch a unit the same access fees it charges competitors. It rules out letting\\nchallengers see its data on customers\\' calling habits. \"We aren\\'t considering\\nmaking anything available other than what the law provides,\" says Lawrence\\nStrickling, Ameritech\\'s vice president of public policy.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0053 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0209 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2329 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220051 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> LLY </CO>\\n<IN> I/DRG I/FIS I/MDV I/MTC </IN>\\n<SB> N/TNM </SB>\\n<MS> M/FIN M/NCY M/TEC </MS>\\n<RE> R/IND R/MA R/NME R/PRM R/US R/WA </RE>\\n<HL> Business Brief -- Eli Lilly & Co.:  Drug Firm Agrees to Sell  Heart-Device \\n    Unit to Bain </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   Eli Lilly & Co., Indianapolis, agreed to sell its Physio-Control Corp. unit\\nto Boston-based Bain Capital Inc., a closely held investment firm.

This month\\'s ray of hope comes from the Chronicle of Higher\\nEducation, the newsweekly of the university set. The Chronicle has its own\\nbestseller list, compiled from sales at dozens of university bookstores across\\nthe nation. It transpires that the books people are buying on our\\nhyper-politicized campuses are . . . well, normal -- if not exactly\\nintellectual.  \\n<p>\\n   The loudest voices on campus decry the oppressive dictatorship of the\\nracist, sexist, ethnocentric patriarchy, but the book that\\'s flying out of the\\nstores is \"In The Kitchen With Rosie\" -- recipes from Oprah Winfrey\\'s cook.\\nApparently more campus types are inside watching \"Oprah\" than are out on the\\nbarricades with the tenured radicals.  \\n<p>\\n   Number two on the list is \"The Celestine Prophesy,\" a book about an ancient\\nPeruvian manuscript that contains revelations on how to achieve spiritual\\nfulfillment. Then comes \"Embraced by the Light,\" about how one woman\\'s\\nnear-death experience led her to make spiritual discoveries. Number four is\\n\"Magic Eye,\" a book of optical effects and no words. Further down comes \"Oh,\\nthe Places You\\'ll Go\" by Dr. Seuss (a common graduation gift, thanks to the\\ntitle), \"The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People,\" William J. Bennett\\'s\\n\"The Book of Virtues\" and some novels, by John Grisham, Mary Higgins Clark and\\n\"The Bridges of Madison County\" by Robert James Waller.  \\n<p>\\n   If there\\'s a theme running through the list, it\\'s a concern for character\\nand spiritual issues, with some people turning to \"The Book of Virtues\" and\\nmore tilting toward the New Age. The author of \"The Celestine Prophesy\"\\nbelieves a new consciousness is seeping through the world that he calls\\n\"transcendent, spiritual.\" The important word here is enchantment and the\\nemphasis is on feeling instead of reasoning. Betty Eadie, the author of\\n\"Embraced by the Light,\" writes that as she passed near death she was cradled\\nby a man with a glittering white beard.  \\n<p>\\n   Previous generations always had something solid to rebel against, a stern\\nvoice in the back of their heads standing up for rigor and respectability. But\\ntoday\\'s college kids were born in 1973 or thereabouts, without many\\n\"repressive\" systems left to destroy or embrace. It\\'s little wonder that many\\nyoung people would go in for the New Age-style wandering, which is often mushy\\nand directionless.  \\n<p>\\n   The 1960s radicals tried to find spiritual fulfillment through political\\ncrusades, but there\\'s little sign of politics or history or biography on this\\nlist. The current New York Times bestseller list, by contrast, is topped by Bob\\nWoodward\\'s \"The Agenda\" and then studded with Republican politicos -- Dan\\nQuayle, Richard Nixon, H.R. Haldeman and Mr. Bennett. Nor do bestselling\\nhistory books on D-Day and the moon landings appear on the campus list.  \\n<p>\\n   The campus list isn\\'t frightening the way a lot of the pronouncements from\\nthe politicized professoriate are, but it is not exactly comforting to find\\nthat the bookstore sales at our intellectual training grounds resemble that of\\nyour average airport bookstore. The campus bestsellers aren\\'t exactly\\nambitious.  \\n<p>\\n   So based on the slight but interesting evidence of this list, we\\'re left\\nwith the image of university book buyers who are spiritually uneasy, not quite\\nwilling to challenge themselves, uninterested in the crusades of the loud\\nvoices of the left and who, if Rosie has anything to say about it, are\\nextremely fit around the waistline.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0056 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0210 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2326 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220054 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> KMB </CO>\\n<IN> I/HOU I/HPN I/HPR </IN>\\n<SB> N/ERN </SB>\\n<MS> M/NCY </MS>\\n<RE> R/NME R/TX R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Business Brief -- Kimberly-Clark Corp.:  Net in 2nd Quarter Rose \\n    14%  And Beat Analysts\\' Estimate </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   Kimberly-Clark Corp. posted a 14% increase in second-quarter earnings,\\ntopping analysts\\' estimates largely because of the inclusion of unremitted\\nearnings from its South African affiliate.  \\n<p>\\n   The company reported net income of $151.5 million, or 94 cents a share.\\nSales rose 6% to of $1.83 billion.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,\\nof Bentonville, Ark., is taking on a rather less well-known company that beat\\nit to the punch in registering the name with the province of Manitoba.  \\n<p>\\n   Winnipeg businessman Edward J. Nych registered the names Wal-Mart (Canada)\\nand Wal-Mart Electronics Inc. in March 1992, two years before the bigger\\nWal-Mart entered the country by acquiring 122 Woolco stores in Canada from\\nWoolworth Corp. Filing documents state that the Winnipeg company plans to sell\\nconsumer electronics, but provincial officials say it doesn\\'t appear to have\\nactually opened a store.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Nych, who couldn\\'t be reached yesterday to comment on the suit, has said\\nhe named his company after his cousins Walter (anglicized from Vladimir) and\\nMartina, who live in Poland. The American Wal-Mart finds this claim less than\\ncompelling.  \\n<p>\\n   Edward Gould, a spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores, said the company feels Mr.\\nNych and two other directors of his concern \"intended to mislead the general\\npublic into believing our trademark belongs to them.\" Though the U.S. Wal-Mart\\nnow operates nine former Woolco stores in Manitoba, none yet bear the Wal-Mart\\nname; Mr. Gould says the nameplates will go up in coming weeks, as the company\\nfinishes renovating and converting the stores to its standards. But he says the\\ngiant retailer established its presence by advertising in Manitoba as long ago\\nas 1990, originally to attract shoppers to Wal-Mart stores in such places as\\nWilliston, N.D.  \\n<p>\\n   Myron Pawlowski, director of Manitoba\\'s corporations branch, which oversees\\nbusiness registrations, says the province had decided to allow both companies\\nto use the Wal-Mart name while it reviews their claims; though such a ruling\\ncould come as soon as next month, the U.S. Wal-Mart chose not to wait.  \\n<p>\\n   Its suit, which seeks an injuction forcing the Winnipeg company to stop\\nusing the Wal-Mart name, doesn\\'t seek specific monetary damages.

Gigot </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   President Clinton may not know what \"universal coverage\" means, but Dan\\nRostenkowski certainly does.  \\n<p>\\n   To the defrocked Ways and Means chairman, the universe is Chicago and\\ncoverage means a 3% interest-rate subsidy to help Northwestern Memorial\\nHospital with its $630 million construction program. Rosty managed to slip that\\nlapidary multimillion-dollar freebie into the 1,500-page Ways and Means health\\nbill.  \\n<p>\\n   To the American Medical Association, meanwhile, universal coverage means a\\ncongressional vote to exempt doctors from antitrust laws. That\\'s what everyone\\nhere assumes is the AMA\\'s expectation, if not explicitly its price, in return\\nfor joining the AFL-CIO this week and endorsing universal coverage and the\\nemployer tax to pay for it.  \\n<p>\\n   Right now doctors can\\'t collude on pricing unless they share risk (as in a\\nclinic). But if government is going to set America\\'s health care budget, the\\ndoctors\\' lobby wants doctors to be able to fix their own, too. I\\'m told the\\nAMA\\'s chief negotiator really isn\\'t Dr. Faustus, but I wonder.  \\n<p>\\n   Isn\\'t last-minute legislating fun? Here in health care\\'s final bacchanal,\\nuniversal coverage has become whatever gets Democrats 218 votes in the House\\nand 50 (plus Al Gore) in the Senate. Raw self-interest rules the day.  \\n<p>\\n   Principle and policy sense, if they ever existed, have vanished in the mad\\nscramble to cobble together enough votes for liberal Democrats to claim another\\nhistoric expansion of the welfare state. These are the same liberals, by the\\nway, who bemoan the declining prestige of government.  \\n<p>\\n   It\\'s all remarkable, especially because never in American history has one\\nparty attempted to make so much social policy with so little support. The\\nClintons like to compare their effort to Social Security and Medicare. But\\nthose were military parades compared with this political riot.  \\n<p>\\n   On April 5, 1935, the Ways and Means Committee passed Social Security, 17-0,\\nwith seven Republicans abstaining. It passed the full House, 372-33. Thirty\\nyears later, on March 23, 1965, Ways and Means passed Medicare, 17-8; it passed\\nthe House, 313-115. Both programs succeeded in the first year of a historically\\nliberal Congress.  \\n<p>\\n   In 1994 Democrats again have huge majorities but nothing like a national\\nconsensus reflected in wide victory margins. A Clinton-like plan passed Ways\\nand Means with only the barest majority, 20-18, and then only this month, with\\njust weeks left in the second year of the most liberal Congress since the\\n1960s.  \\n<p>\\n   Every poll shows support for anything like ClintonCare down near 40%, but\\nClintonians claim weakness is strength. \"Going from 55% to 42% is no big deal,\"\\nsaid presidential pollster Stan Greenberg last week; the voters have merely\\nbeen gulled by critics. Yet there was another democratic test in California in\\n1992, when a Clinton-like plan with an employer mandate ran as a ballot\\nproposition. It lost by more than 2-to-1 -- in the same year Mr. Clinton\\ncarried the state easily.  \\n<p>\\n   No matter; this is liberalism\\'s last great opening for a generation, so the\\nrush is on for \"coverage.\" New York Sen. Pat Moynihan, for example, has tried\\nto push Democrats to a more sensible center. But having failed, he has now\\ncovered his own re-election chances by assessing a 1.75% tax on insurance\\npremiums (yours) to create a new trust fund for the nation\\'s academic medical\\ncenters. Many of those centers are in New York state.  \\n<p>\\n   No one knows how much this little beauty will cost, but a spokesman for the\\nsenator says that $40 billion over five years is \"probably in the ball park.\"\\nAt least Sen. Moynihan is honest about his intentions. When asked during his\\nSenate Finance Committee markup about the cost of another provision, he\\nreplied, in what ought to be the epitaph for this entire debate, \"I don\\'t\\nbelieve we have the least idea.\"  \\n<p>\\n   All of this is more than the usual Nafta-type logrolling. Opening up health\\ncare choices to politicians is in fact what the Clinton plan is all about.\\nCongress suddenly gets vast new power to decide what\\'s covered and what isn\\'t,\\nwho gets subsidies and who doesn\\'t; the members get vast new clout. And\\nhealth-care providers -- doctors, nurses, pharmacists -- become huge new\\nconstituencies for ever greater benefits.  \\n<p>\\n   Take the chiropractors, who may be the biggest winners so far under\\nClintonCare. For years Medicare has denied the spinal-tappers reimbursement for\\nX-rays, as do many private insurers. So when Mr. Clinton was elected, \"we\\nkicked into high gear,\" says Richard Miller, the chiropractor lobbyist.  \\n<p>\\n   They deluged Congress, especially members on Ways and Means, with mail,\\nvisits, TV ads in certain districts, and of course political donations. They\\nsextupled their PAC revenues to $1.5 million in 1993. It all worked. Democrats\\nwrote an amendment to cover chiropractor X-rays, plus other language that may\\ncover everything else they do. Of course if the extra spending gives taxpayers\\nmore back pain, chiropractors won\\'t mind that either.  \\n<p>\\n   This is the future of American health care if anything like the Clinton plan\\npasses. It explains why universal government coverage is so popular among\\nliberals, who are confident about their own omniscience. But it may also\\nexplain why the Clinton plan becomes less popular the more people know about\\nit. Distrusting politics, Americans without friends on Ways and Means don\\'t\\nwant their health care system run by politicians.  \\n<p>\\n   If Bill Clinton and his fellow liberals insist on pushing their plan through\\nCongress, they could take his presidency down with it.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0062 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0211 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2318 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220060 </ACCESN>\\n<PAGE> A1          </PAGE>\\n<HL> What\\'s News --  Business and Finance </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   COMCAST AND LIBERTY Media are joining in a $1.4 billion bid for the QVC\\nshares they don\\'t already own.

The latest period represents the airline\\'s\\nfourth consecutive profitable quarter. Revenue increased 8.5% to $2.27 billion\\nfrom $2.1 billion a year ago. Second-quarter results included a noncash charge\\nof $47.7 million related to stock-based employee compensation.  \\n<p>\\n   The results surprised Wall Street, which had been forecasting per-share\\nresults of 20 cents to 46 cents. The profit also reassured investors, some of\\nwhom have questioned the airline\\'s viability since it returned to public\\nownership last March in a $260 million public offering.  \\n<p>\\n   Northwest stock rose this week to $18, a 52-week high. After earnings were\\nreleased, shares fell 43.75 cents to $17.1875 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.\\nNorthwest attributed the drop to \"profit-taking.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Northwest, which had been taken private in a 1989 leveraged buyout, still is\\ncarrying a heavy load of more than $4 billion in long-term debt.

Since the\\nbeginning of the year, the airline has dropped unprofitable routes and scaled\\nback its operations in markets such as Seoul, South Korea, and Memphis, Tenn.\\nAt the same time, it has added 33 new routes to its hubs in Minneapolis and\\nDetroit.  \\n<p>\\n   Because of its limited presence on the East Coast, Northwest has remained\\nrelatively unaffected by low-cost carriers which have sparked major fare wars.\\nFor the quarter, the airline\\'s revenue per available passenger mile increased\\n10.3%, to 10.52 cents from 9.54 cents. The company reduced overall flying by\\n1.8%. Load factor, or the percentage of available seats filled, remained\\nunchanged from the yearearlier figure at 68%.  \\n<p>\\n   Northwest has played by a conservative strategy since last summer, when its\\nunions agreed to $886 million in wage concessions in exchange for a 27% stake\\nin the company.

CTAs who\\nuse computer systems to spot price trends for trading purposes generally\\nperform best when there\\'s a major trend in currency movements. And as the\\ndollar languished in tight ranges for the first five months of 1994, those\\nmarket players found it difficult to book trading profits.  \\n<p>\\n   But in June, as the dollar began to weaken, they staged an abrupt comeback.\\nOf 39 currency managers whose performance is tracked by the Ferrell FX Index,\\n86% were profitable in June, compared with only 31% in May.  \\n<p>\\n   The index includes both systematic (computer using) and fundamental traders\\n(who rely largely on news-oriented analyses), but William Ferrell, president of\\nFerrell Capital Management in Greenwich, Conn., which computes the index, said\\nthat computer traders outperformed fundamental players. \"Trend-followers have\\nbeen the ones that have got the most out of the moves in June and July,\" he\\nasserted.  \\n<p>\\n   Analysts estimate that systems traders account for 30% to 50% of currency\\nmarket activity, and their participation tends to reinforce trends. One reason:\\nThey often commit more capital to a strong trend.  \\n<p>\\n   Moreover, they don\\'t generally take profits or anticipate the end of a rally\\nor sell-off. Instead, they keep buying or selling until the dollar reverses.  \\n<p>\\n   Systems traders are hurt when the dollar is locked in a narrow trading range\\nbecause their computer programs issue a \"buy\" or \"sell\" signal only when the\\ndollar has moved in one direction far enough and long enough to constitute a\\ntrend as defined by the system designers. The small moves that prevailed early\\nin the year gave the systems nothing to latch on to.  \\n<p>\\n   But from early June to early July, the dollar fell 7% against both the mark\\nand the yen, generating trading profits for the systems traders that almost\\nmade up for earlier losses.  \\n<p>\\n   At Millburn Richfield Corp., for example, a gain of 10.2% in June reduced\\nyear-to-date losses to 0.5%. Millburn\\'s vice chairman, George Crapple, said\\nthat system traders benefited from indifference to fundamental factors, such as\\ninterest-rate convergence between the U.S. and Germany, that pointed to a\\nhigher dollar.  \\n<p>\\n   \"Trend followers were probably quicker to indentify this downleg than\\nfundamental players, many of whom had the view that the dollar was going to\\nstrengthen in 1994,\" Mr. Crapple said.  \\n<p>\\n   And once the dollar began sinking, fundamentalists faced a dilemma, Mr.\\nFerrell said. Selling dollars contradicted their economic analysis; buying\\ndollars contradicted market sentiment.  \\n<p>\\n   \"If you don\\'t like dollar at 1.60 marks, you certainly don\\'t want it at\\n1.53,\" Mr. Ferrell said. Systems traders, by contrast, don\\'t make such value\\njudgments. \"Trend followers aren\\'t afraid of a lack of correlation between\\neconomic data and market response,\" he added.  \\n<p>\\n   They\\'ve also outpaced fundamentalists by risking more capital, Mr. Ferrell\\nsays.  \\n<p>\\n   Trend-followers, like many fundamental currency market players who lost\\nmoney in currencies early in the year, pulled money out of the market,\\nreinvesting when the dollar began sinking.  \\n<p>\\n   For example, Thomas Aspray, chief analyst at APM Forex Service, a Spokane,\\nWash., analytical and training concern, advised clients to cut their exposure\\nto as little as 20% of their portfolios. In early June he recommended investing\\n100% and using leverage to eke out a still greater return.  \\n<p>\\n   Now that the dollar has turned higher, he recommends risking only 25% to 50%\\nof a portfolio. \"Although analysis still suggests that the long-term trend is\\nlower, the first leg is over,\" he says.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0065 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0211 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2313 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220063 </ACCESN>\\n<GV> G/DEF G/EXE G/JUS </GV>\\n<SB> N/EDC N/LAW N/LEN </SB>\\n<RE> R/CL R/LTM R/NME R/PE R/SM R/US </RE>\\n<HL> REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial):  Drug Unintelligence </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   The Clinton Administration\\'s drug policies are a running sore. The President\\ndidn\\'t inhale. The Surgeon General muses about legalization as her son is\\nbusted on a drug offense. A former associate of a drug convict runs White House\\nadministration, including drug testing for staff members. The biggest whopper\\nof all: The Administration stops sharing radar surveillance of air flights in\\ndrug areas in the Andes because Colombia threatens to shoot down suspect\\nplanes.  \\n<p>\\n   This is because the Pentagon is worried about potential legal liability,\\nthey explain. Only in America. Various efforts, mostly clumsy, are under way\\ntoward resuming sharing intelligence, but it will take a long time to repair\\nthe damage already done to a painfully forged program of cooperation with\\nColombia and Peru. The spectacle is a telling one.  \\n<p>\\n   Now, the legal issues involved are real enough. In the wake of the Soviet\\ndowning of KAL 007, international aviation conventions adopted some sweeping\\nprohibitions on attacks on civil aircraft, and these have been implemented in\\nU.S. law. Even in the Bush Administration, Defense Department lawyers were\\narguing that this prohibited aiding and abetting drug interdiction in the\\nAndes. This legal fanaticism was suppressed by the Bush foreign policy\\napparatus, but it burst out when the DoD summarily suspended its intelligence\\nsharing on May 1. And in a Clinton Administration fillip, a coven of lawyers\\ndecided that the laws would subject individual government personnel to criminal\\npenalties.  \\n<p>\\n   Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick has taken most of the heat for these\\ndecisions, with some Republicans on Capitol Hill wondering about her\\nrepresentation of BCCI-scandal figures Clark Clifford and Robert Altman. It is\\ncertainly true that if some similarly bizarre policy came out of the Colombian\\nor Peruvian governments, we would be scrutinizing their officials for suspect\\nassociations. But Ms. Gorelick\\'s letter to the national security agencies\\nsaying that the suspension was \"imperative\" came after the policy was already\\nin effect, and she has written relevant Congressmen to deny she addressed the\\nissue in her previous post as Pentagon general counsel.  \\n<p>\\n   The initial impetus for the policy change, rather, seems to lie in the\\nmilitary\\'s discomfort with anti-drug missions. This underlying impulse was no\\ndoubt aggravated by a long-running dispute over a 1992 incident in which\\nPeruvian jets accidentally fired on a U.S. C-130, killing an Air Force\\nsergeant. And by the accident in which American fighters shot down two U.S.\\nhelicopters in Iraq. While held in check during the previous Administration, in\\nthe current one these emotions forged ready alliances with notions about the\\ntranscendence of international law and doubts about \"militarizing the drug\\nwar.\"  \\n<p>\\n   And legal opinions were allowed to overwhelm policy. If Colombia cannot\\nshoot down planes it suspects of drug-running, are we to give drug-runners\\nflying over our borders free reign to ignore attempts to force them to land?\\nWhen the Justice Department hypothesizes about criminal penalties, is it\\nactually threatening to bring such prosecutions against government officials\\nrather than apply its discretion to cases where there was no criminal intent?\\nAnd in the end, is it not an executive decision whether certain legal risks\\nshould be run?  \\n<p>\\n   Despite some hypothetical legal risk, after all, the circumstances would\\nseem to offer a de minimus \"business risk,\" as a private lawyer would call it.\\nNo lawsuits have been filed, nor, it seems, have any planes been shot down. The\\nColombians have discussed careful procedures about when they would or wouldn\\'t\\nshoot. Surely the intelligence cooperation could have been continued while any\\nnecessary legal changes were made; the abrupt rupture was flatly unwarranted.  \\n<p>\\n   What we are dealing with here is abject failure of leadership. It is up to a\\nPresident to keep his generals in line, and his lawyers too. If generals don\\'t\\nrespect their commander or his entourage they can call on well-honed\\nbureaucratic skills concerning drug policy or shipboard bathrobes. If lawyers\\naren\\'t given clear direction, they will take over any business. And if a leader\\ncommunicates that he\\'s not serious about some policy area, private agendas will\\ntake over.  \\n<p>\\n   Faced with Congressional outrage and political embarrassment, the\\nAdministration now backs a provision that says shooting down civil aircraft is\\nOK under certain circumstances, and this has been adopted by the Senate. The\\nHouse, by contrast, has approved an amendment simply saying that providing\\nintelligence does not imply intent to break international law.

Feduschak  Special to The Wall Street \\n    Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   LVIV, Ukraine -- The big cross hanging from around the neck of the Most Rev.\\nOrest Karelin is partly obscured by his long, thinning hair and unkempt beard.\\nAn old Soviet army belt holds together his worn black robe.  \\n<p>\\n   As he stares out at the audience that has gathered for an international\\nmonarchist conference here to debate who is the true king of Ukraine, his eyes\\nlight up.  \\n<p>\\n   \"I crawled to Madrid because I wanted to see my king!\" he shouts.  \\n<p>\\n   To nobody\\'s surprise, a response is not long in coming, from an equally\\nconfident voice: \"He is not the king! I am the true monarch of Ukraine.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Not everyone in this country seems to have adjusted to the current political\\nrealities. Ukraine\\'s monarchists -- estimates of their number range from\\nhundreds to tens of thousands -- want to restore a monarchy that has\\ntechnically reigned for only four days altogether in this century. They say the\\nrecently elected president, Leonid Kuchma, represents a governmental concept\\nintroduced just three years ago and one that should be abolished. Unhappy with\\nthe country\\'s economic decline and political turmoil, royalists also say that\\nnow is a good time to introduce a constitutional monarchy. Ukraine hasn\\'t\\nadopted a constitution since the country declared independence from the Soviet\\nUnion in 1991.  \\n<p>\\n   Never mind: For the past three years, filling Ukraine\\'s theoretical throne\\nhas preoccupied an active fringe group, including a variety of\\npretender-contenders. The press is full of pictures and profiles of the latest\\nhopefuls. Seminars have been held, and no fewer than four new monarchist\\norganizations have thrown their support behind one candidate or another.  \\n<p>\\n   But the leading men who would be king are Prince Alexis (Vassilievich\\nDolgorouky-Rurikovich) II and Prince Michael Karachevski-Volk. Though neither\\nwas born in Ukraine and Prince Alexis has never even been here, both claim\\nregal roots that, if their genealogies are to be believed, go back very far.\\nBoth candidacies also fuel such strong emotions that the international\\nmonarchist conference, held last year here, nearly ended in a fistfight.  \\n<p>\\n   It was Paris-born Prince Michael, a 61-year-old former seminarian, who\\nshouted down Bishop Karelin\\'s claims about his crawl to Madrid. This prince\\ntravels often to Ukraine from Warsaw, his adopted hometown. He says he did a\\nstint as an attache at the French Embassy in Moscow but then went into business\\n20 years ago. He now has a number of ventures in Ukraine, including one that\\nbuilds furniture.  \\n<p>\\n   Prince Michael says his father told him early in life he was heir to the\\nUkrainian throne. But it seemed a pointless title to have while the Soviet\\nUnion existed. \"No one ever thought Ukraine would be free,\" he says.  \\n<p>\\n   For his part, Prince Alexis confirms the Coptic Church bishop\\'s pilgrimage\\nto Madrid, calling it \"an incredible story, a romantic story.\" The 46-year-old\\nprince settled in the Spanish capital 20 years ago after traveling extensively,\\nand today works with a number of charities. \"People are more willing to give\\nmoney if Alexis is involved,\" he says from Madrid.  \\n<p>\\n   As different as they are, both men have a couple of things in common besides\\nkingly ambitions: Both are divorced and each has a son to ensure that the\\nUkrainian monarchy lives on.  \\n<p>\\n   The genial, white-haired Prince Michael says he grew up in the fashionable\\nParis parlors of Russia\\'s and Ukraine\\'s exiled royalty. He presents a\\npersonally documented family tree dating to 13th-century Kievan Rus, the\\nmedieval empire centered in Kiev that included much of present-day Ukraine and\\nBelarus. A forebear was the little-known Prince Mstyslav, whose father was the\\nRussian Orthodox Church\\'s St. Michael of Chernihiv. St. Michael\\'s ancestry,\\nPrince Michael says, goes back to the Riuriks of Kievan Rus.  \\n<p>\\n   Prince Alexis was born in Zaire on his parents\\' estate, called Villa\\nUkrania. Sitting regally in his small Madrid apartment among portraits of his\\nrelatives, the balding Prince Alexis says simply, \"This is the royal family. .\\n. . I am the volodar sovereign of Ukraine.\"  \\n<p>\\n   He presents photocopied materials from various monarchist publications\\nsupporting his claim that on his father\\'s side his lineage can be traced to\\nPrince Riurik of the Russian city of Novgorod. Riurik\\'s son Ihor was Kiev\\'s\\nsecond ruler, governing from 912 to 945.  \\n<p>\\n   Prince Alexis also claims to be a Romanov on his mother\\'s side, and\\ntherefore heir to the Russian throne, too. He is working on a book that\\ndisputes the usual history, in which the Russian royal family was shot by\\nBolsheviks. Prince Alexis says that his grandmother, Maria, was Czar Nicholas\\nII\\'s daughter and that she escaped death with the czarina and her three\\nsisters, Olga, Tatiana and Anastasia. They eventually made it to Romania, where\\nthey were helped by its royal family, he says.  \\n<p>\\n   In the competition with Prince Michael, so far Prince Alexis has had more\\nluck in arguing his case -- although some Ukrainians wonder whether the man\\nhimself exists. He has failed to show up in Kiev on a number of occasions when\\nhis pending arrival was well publicized. The reason, he says: \"According to the\\nlaw, if I want to go there, I have to go as a Spanish citizen who has a visa. I\\nwill never do that. The day I have a Ukrainian passport is the day I will go.\"\\nUnder Ukraine law, that day won\\'t come until after he has renounced his Spanish\\ncitizenship.  \\n<p>\\n   Prince Alexis also has the redoubtable Bishop Karelin on his side. The\\nbishop, who heads Ukraine\\'s Union of Monarchists, is one of the prince\\'s three\\nofficial representatives in Ukraine, an honor he received after his\\nknee-bruising trek to Madrid. The bishop is now busy lobbying Ukrainian army\\nofficers for support.  \\n<p>\\n   \"The army has always been the backbone of a monarchy,\" explains Bishop\\nKarelin, \"but our officers live poorly because salaries are low. A monarch will\\nchange that.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Ihor Melnichuk, Ukraine\\'s defense minister, giggles when presented with such\\nclaims. \"Really, I\\'ve never met anyone who wants a monarchy,\" he says. \"Why\\nshould we want to have yet another leader standing over us?\"  \\n<p>\\n   Finally -- as if he needed more -- Prince Alexis bears the title Grand Duke\\nof Kiev, awarded by the Russian government two years ago in a ceremony held in\\nthe Kremlin, according to Pauline Butler, vice president of Hawaii\\'s Greenwich\\nUniversity and co-author of the book Prince Alexis is writing. Russian\\nPresident Boris Yeltsin \"is very aware\" of who Prince Alexis is, Ms. Butler\\nsays, and adds, \"So was Gorbachev.\" She doesn\\'t explain just how it is that\\nMoscow can designate grand dukes in another country.  \\n<p>\\n   Although he hasn\\'t received the endorsements Prince Alexis has, Prince\\nMichael isn\\'t doing too bad a job of winning friends in high places. At the\\nUkrainian Embassy in Warsaw, one official notes that the prince is a frequent\\nand welcome visitor. He can\\'t confirm, however, Prince Michael\\'s claim that he\\nreceived a letter from Ukraine\\'s ambassador to Poland in which the prince was\\naddressed as \"Your Highness.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Carlta Vitzthum in Madrid contributed to this article.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0069 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0212 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2306 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220067 </ACCESN>\\n<GV> G/FED </GV>\\n<SB> N/CBK N/EDC N/FIN N/FRX </SB>\\n<RE> R/NME R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Bretton Woods -- 50 Years On:  As Good as Gold  ----  By Wayne Angell </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   Alan Greenspan showed he has gold in his bones Wednesday when he testified\\nbefore Congress that he sees gold prices as an indicator of inflation. It was\\nthe second time this year that the Fed chairman has mentioned the metal in such\\na public venue. But what precisely is gold\\'s role in monetary policy? This week\\nin fact provides a particularly favorable moment for discussion of this\\nquestion. Fifty years ago this summer, delegates from 44 allied countries met\\nat Bretton Woods, N.H. and established the wrong kind of gold standard.  \\n<p>\\n   The Bretton Woods representatives sought to re-establish an international\\ncurrency system based on gold. But they had mixed and conflicting objectives,\\nand not surprisingly, ended up proposing a mixed system. On the one hand, they\\ncreated the International Monetary Fund, which allowed nations flexibility in\\nexchange rates to prevent domestic political turmoil. On the other hand, they\\nstaked a commitment to stable commodity values for currencies. Under Bretton\\nWoods, currencies were \"fixed\" at $35 an ounce. But gold was not truly\\nconvertible, and the compromise was bound to self-destruct.  \\n<p>\\n   The guests at Bretton Woods worried about the future of Europe\\'s currencies.\\nNo one at the conference envisioned that the priority of domestic policy would\\nlead America down the devaluation route. What the delegates did not understand\\nwas that (beyond the IMF), there was a second flaw in the system, and it lay\\nwith the U.S. central bank. There was no free market in gold. There was no\\nmarket mechanism that forced the Fed to automatically adjust bank reserves as\\nthe supply of gold fluctuated. The Fed\\'s $35-an-ounce promise was very\\ndifficult to monitor. In effect, the dollar was not anchored to gold.  \\n<p>\\n   To understand what was wrong with Bretton Woods, it helps to look back.\\nDuring the 150 years in which the world\\'s exchange rate system was operated on\\na gold standard, Britain had no government-controlled central bank. The Bank of\\nEngland was then a private bank and issued its own currency.  \\n<p>\\n   The bank\\'s gold standard meant it made monetary policy adjustments\\nautomatically. If a country ran a trade deficit with Britain, the result would\\nbe a flow of gold to Britain. This inflow of gold resulted in an automatic\\nmonetary expansion. Sterling begets sterling, and dollars beget dollars, but\\ngold bars do not lay eggs of gold coin. So if the Bank of England did not issue\\nmoney when it took in new gold, gold would crowd out earning assets, and\\nprofits would fall. By issuing new notes, the bank could acquire additional\\nassets of the kind that earn money.  \\n<p>\\n   The amazing thing about this arrangement is that the Bank of England did it\\nwithout owning much gold. All it did was make a promise -- a promise the bank\\nwas highly motivated to keep. In other words, the Bank of England and Britain\\nwere on a gold-targeting system -- the very kind Mr. Greenspan appeared to\\nallude to this week!  \\n<p>\\n   This monetary expansion boosted imports into Britain and lessened the\\nadjustment difficulties of deficit countries. Since sterling was freely\\nconvertible into gold, the world\\'s reserve system had a true gold anchor.\\nInflationary monetary policy could not be pursued, since it would result in an\\noutflow of gold, which in turn would automatically correct a bank policy error.\\nAmerica\\'s interwar gold standard lacked some of the essential ingredients of\\nthe old British system. Gold flowed to the U.S. But since the Fed was a\\ngovernment central bank, not a private one, it made its own policy decisions,\\ndecisions which had nothing to do with profit. They substituted their own\\njudgment for the profit motive. Adam Smith\\'s invisible hand was gone.  \\n<p>\\n   There was no automatic adjustment mechanism -- and the Fed did not expand\\nthe money supply as gold came in. Many economists blame the deflation, and even\\nthe Great Depression, on the gold standard. But it wasn\\'t a gold standard! The\\ntruth is that if the U.S. had expanded the money supply to correspond to its\\nnew gold reserves, it would have avoided the deflation and depression.  \\n<p>\\n   Bretton Woods, in effect, repeated some of the problems of the pre-war\\nsystem. It too had no automatic adjustment mechanism for the anchor currency.  \\n<p>\\n   Some foresightful folks recognized this. Henry Simon of the University of\\nChicago was correct in worrying that Bretton Woods failed to commit the U.S. to\\na domestic price-stability standard. Mr. Simon thought that nations actually\\nsought to protect the value of their own reserve assets through currency\\nconvertibility with the dollar. True currency convertibility would compel each\\ngovernment to pursue domestic policies consistent with price stability. But if\\neach government wanted domestic price stability, it had to adopt an appropriate\\ndomestic policy. He recognized the inherent contradiction between Bretton Woods\\nand the IMF.  \\n<p>\\n   The U.K. itself hedged on the issue. John Maynard Keynes, who represented\\nBritain at Bretton Woods, wanted more flexibility than the Americans would\\nagree to. In this sense, Keynes was acting \"Keynesian\": He wanted the power to\\ngoose demand domestically in his country and more freedom to finance domestic\\ndebt. He must have suspected that public policy would favor a monetary policy\\ninconsistent with price stability.  \\n<p>\\n   What Keynes and the other delegates to Bretton Woods failed to recognize\\nwere some basic economic facts. They wanted costly social agendas their nations\\ncould not afford. They forsook the goal of sound money and allowed inflation.\\nMonetary policy without a central bank-government pledge to maintain a stable\\ncommodity value for its currency guarantees high penalty interest rates. The\\nhigh rates Britain, and, eventually, the U.S. would be forced to pay made money\\nso dear they could no longer afford their social programs.  \\n<p>\\n   It took a while for these lessons to sink in. No one was surprised by\\nsuccessive devaluations by the United Kingdom. But no one contemplated that\\nmonetary policy in the United States would lose its underlying pledge to pay\\ngold at $35 an ounce by tilting to accommodate a social agenda. Who cared when\\nthe U.S. closed its gold window and then devalued to $42 dollars an ounce?\\nAfter all, the price of gold was only a promise to central banks. Monetary\\npolicy in the U.S. had no check in the form of an operational link to the price\\nof gold. No one knew what a free market in gold would have signaled if\\nAmericans had been free to buy gold.  \\n<p>\\n   When the Great Society program demand for resources met Vietnam War\\nproduction demands the pegged Fed funds rate fell further and further behind\\nthe natural rate. So open market operations to keep the Fed funds rate lower\\nwere of the buying type. The Fed bought Treasury bills and paid for them with\\ndeposit slips. These deposit slips were increases in high-powered money that\\nsupplied the world with more dollar reserves than were demanded. The underlying\\nprice of gold soared, eventually forcing the U.S. to recant on its promise or\\nsurrender all gold reserves and then recant.  \\n<p>\\n   The floating exchange rate era has taught us some valuable lessons. First,\\nfloating exchange rates do not enable a country to avoid a high interest rate\\npenalty for overspending on wars or domestic projects. Second,\\nfloating-exchange rates provide no automatic corrective mechanism to ease\\nmonetary policy and thereby to reduce excess savings for chronic\\nbalance-of-trade surplus countries such as Japan. Nor do floating exchange\\nrates automatically provide a restrained monetary policy for countries with a\\nlow savings rate and hence a chronic balance-of-trade deficit position such as\\nthe U.S. These imbalances threaten to increase exchange-rate volatility.  \\n<p>\\n   The best way to guarantee stable exchange rates is to join in a commitment\\nto zero inflation. This week, Mr. Greenspan appeared to make a gesture toward\\nmoving in the right direction. What is necessary is for a major reserve\\ncurrency country to pledge a stable domestic price level or a stable currency\\nalignment with gold. No country can be a major reserve currency country without\\ncompeting with the U.S. in having the largest open market in the world. (No one\\nlikes to borrow in yen, because it is difficult to sell goods or services to\\nJapan, and so earn the cash to pay back the debt.)  \\n<p>\\n   The U.S. at the present time has something of a feeling of the late 1960s.\\nWe have enjoyed the benefits of gradual disinflation. But the direction of\\npolicy has shifted. The price of gold, at over $380 an ounce, is inconsistent\\nwith the path to price stability. That is what Mr. Greenspan recognizes, and\\nthat is what he must act upon. A decisive action of, say, a 100-basis-point\\nhike in short-term interest rates is needed. If such action is not taken soon,\\nthe costs of returning to the path of price stability become ever larger.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Angell, a former Fed governor, watches the economy for Bear, Stearns.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0070 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0212 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2253 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220068 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> BV VIA VIAB </CO>\\n<IN> I/ENT I/MOV I/OTS I/REC I/RTS </IN>\\n<SB> N/ANL N/HIY N/STK N/TNM N/WEI </SB>\\n<MS> M/CYC </MS>\\n<RE> R/FL R/MA R/NME R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Viacom Stock Rise Gives Hope to Deal  For Blockbuster, but Opposition \\n    Remains  ----  By Greg Steinmetz and Anita Sharpe  Staff Reporters \\n    of The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   Some instititional investors who previously opposed Viacom Inc.\\'s\\nacquisition of Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. say they would now support the\\ndeal because of the recent rally in Viacom\\'s stock.  \\n<p>\\n   But Blockbuster Chairman H. Wayne Huizenga remains opposed to the deal, and\\nhas threatened to quit if Viacom holds him to the acquisition agreement, say\\npeople familiar with the situation. And Blockbuster officials say they do not\\nbelieve their board or shareholders will approve the deal unless Viacom stock\\nrises even higher.  \\n<p>\\n   Nevertheless, the enthusiasm of some money managers gives a glimmer of hope\\nto a huge merger that had been all but given up for dead. And, for their part,\\nViacom officials say they could still do the deal without Mr. Huizenga but\\nmight balk if other top managers resign as well.  \\n<p>\\n   In January, Viacom agreed to buy Blockbuster with a package of securities\\nthen valued at $8.4 billion. Although the value of the deal is now $6.5\\nbillion, Viacom is eager to get Blockbuster\\'s enormous cash flow to help pay\\nback the debt created by its recent purchase of Paramount Communications Inc.  \\n<p>\\n   Before the Blockbuster acquisition was announced, Viacom Class B shares\\ntraded at $42.75 and Blockbuster traded at $29.875. But since then, Viacom fell\\nas low as $21.75, meaning Blockbuster shareholders would get far less in the\\ndeal than what their stock would be worth if the acquisition collapsed.  \\n<p>\\n   In recent weeks, however, Viacom stock has rallied. Yesterday, for the first\\ntime in months, the Viacom deal would give Blockbuster shareholders a premium\\nover the current market price of their shares.  \\n<p>\\n   In American Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Viacom shares closed at\\n$33.50, up 75 cents. Blockbuster was unchanged at $26.375 in New York Stock\\nExchange composite trading. The deal with Viacom would give Blockbuster\\nshareholders 25 cents to 50 cents more than its current stock price, traders\\nsaid.  \\n<p>\\n   \"At the current prices, I would be comfortable voting for the merger,\" said\\nLawrence Haverty, a portfolio manager with State Street Management and Research\\nin Boston.  \\n<p>\\n   But Blockbuster\\'s board is unlikely to vote in favor of the acquisition\\nunless Blockbuster shareholders received a value at or close to the original\\nagreement of about $31 a share. Before the board would support a deal, \"the\\ncircumstances would probably have to be the same as they were in January\" when\\nthe merger was announced, said Thomas Hawkins, Blockbuster\\'s senior vice\\npresident and general counsel.  \\n<p>\\n   Viacom and Blockbuster are legally locked into an agreement until Sept. 30\\nunless shareholders turn it down before then. In addition, Blockbuster\\nmanagers, including Mr. Huizenga, are committed to voting in favor of the deal.\\n \\n<p>\\n   Yet from a practical standpoint, if Blockbuster wanted to get out of the\\ndeal, it could find a way. One way is for its top managers to threaten to quit.\\n\"Viacom wouldn\\'t want to do the deal without them,\" said one person close to\\nViacom.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Huizenga, who has a tense relationship with Viacom Chairman Sumner\\nRedstone, was unavailable to comment on whether he threatened to quit. But\\nBlockbuster\\'s Mr. Hawkins said, \"I can\\'t imagine that he would say that.\"  \\n<p>\\n   On Monday, people close to Blockbuster were expecting the acquisition to be\\ncalled off prior to Sept. 30, by which date the agreement will expire if\\nBlockbuster officials haven\\'t called a shareholder vote on the issue. But,\\naccording to a person in the Viacom camp, \"there\\'s no incentive for Viacom to\\ncall it off.\"  \\n<p>\\n   In a conference call with analysts and shareholders following Blockbuster\\'s\\nearnings report this week, however, a Blockbuster executive suggested that the\\ndeal could effectively die much earlier than the end of September. The\\nexecutive, according to a shareholder who participated in the conference call,\\nnoted that Blockbuster would have to give shareholders 20 business days notice\\nto vote on the deal, which could make any merger moot by the first week of\\nSeptember.  \\n<p>\\n   Viacom stock has risen in recent weeks because of optimism about the\\ncompany\\'s prospects after its acquistion of Paramount. Meanwhile, Blockbuster\\'s\\nstock has fallen this week after its earnings, which rose 31%, came in on the\\nlow end of expectations.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0071 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0212 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2253 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220069 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> AIT BEL BLS CMCSA CMCSK GTE LBTYA LBTYB QVCN TCOMA TCOMB </CO>\\n<IN> I/BRD I/LDS I/MED I/OTS I/RTL I/RTS I/TLS </IN>\\n<SB> N/ANL N/HIY N/TNM N/WEI </SB>\\n<MS> M/CYC M/UTI </MS>\\n<RE> R/CO R/CT R/GA R/IL R/NME R/PA R/US R/WY </RE>\\n<HL> Liberty Media  Joins Comcast  In Bid for QVC  ---  Cash Offer Is \\n    $44 a Share,  Or Total of $1.4 Billion;  Rival Proposals Possible \\n     ----  By Laura Landro and Mark Robichaux  Staff Reporters of The \\n    Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   In a show of cable-industry muscle power, Comcast Corp. and Liberty Media\\nCorp. are joining in a new $44-a-share, $1.4 billion all-cash offer for the 65%\\nof home shopping network QVC Inc. that they don\\'t already own.  \\n<p>\\n   The offer, which teams QVC\\'s two largest shareholders in a formidable\\nalliance, replaces Comcast\\'s previous $2.2 billion offer to buy the 84.5% of\\nQVC it alone doesn\\'t own in a combination of cash and securities that had also\\nbeen valued at $44 a share.  \\n<p>\\n   Comcast and Liberty would own 57% and 43% respectively of QVC if they\\nacquired all the remaining shares.  \\n<p>\\n   The all-cash offer from Comcast and Liberty, which is itself in the process\\nof being acquired by Tele-Communications Inc., is likely to be viewed as more\\nattractive to holders than the previous Comcast offer, which provided only $37\\nin cash per share.  \\n<p>\\n   Under their new offer, Comcast, which owns 15.5% of QVC, and Liberty, which\\nowns 19%, would contribute their stock valued at about $1 billion into a new\\nentity. That entity would, in turn, borrow the balance of the purchase price.\\nLiberty won\\'t contribute any cash, but Comcast, which will be the managing\\npartner of QVC, will only have to come up with a more manageable $230 million\\nin cash itself.  \\n<p>\\n   TCI and Liberty appear to make out the best, remaining a major QVC holder\\nfor no additional investment and avoiding paying any taxes on a sale. But the\\npartnership is also better for Comcast, which under its own offer would have\\nhad to sell assets or borrow additional funds to come up with nearly $700\\nmillion for the cash portion and add considerable debt to its own balance\\nsheet.  \\n<p>\\n   The new Comcast-Liberty offer is the latest twist in the saga that began\\nwhen Comcast recruited entertainment whiz Barry Diller to become chairman of\\nQVC, and then backed him in a bid for Paramount Communications Inc. When that\\nbid failed, Mr. Diller made his own deal to merge QVC with CBS Inc., but that\\ndeal was scuttled when Comcast made a rival offer for QVC.  \\n<p>\\n   Liberty, which initially backed both Mr. Diller\\'s bid for Paramount and his\\ndeal with CBS, now is teaming up with Comcast to keep QVC in the hands of cable\\noperators -- and Mr. Diller\\'s plans are again up in the air.  \\n<p>\\n   Said one adviser involved in the transaction yesterday, \"all the players are\\njust changing seats at the table in this deal.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Some large shareholders said yesterday that they still expect bids from\\ncable rivals such as telephone companies. Though BellSouth Corp. is considered\\nthe only serious bidder, Wall Street yesterday floated other names such as Bell\\nAtlantic Corp., GTE Corp. and Ameritech Corp. Officials of the phone concerns\\ncouldn\\'t be reached.  \\n<p>\\n   \"Everyone is assuming that because TCI and Comcast have thrown in their lot\\ntogether that no other bidder will bother to come in,\" said one large QVC\\nholder. \"I don\\'t think that\\'s accurate, and I for one would like to see a\\nhigher bid.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Some large institutional investors said they believe QVC could fetch $50 to\\n$55 a share in a real auction. QVC said yesterday, in response to the new\\nComcast-Liberty offer, that it will continue to seek to maximize the value for\\nits shareholders but declined to say to whom else it was talking.  \\n<p>\\n   Mario Gabelli, whose Gabelli funds own stock in QVC, said that he still\\nbelieves a telephone company, perhaps in partnership with a major retailer,\\ncould mount a rival offer. To satisfy holders, he added that Comcast and\\nLiberty might agree to a \"kiss,\" a Wall Street trader\\'s term for a slightly\\nimproved offer.  \\n<p>\\n   But others on Wall Street said other companies might be hesitant to mount a\\nrival bid against the two largest shareholders of QVC, which also are QVC\\'s\\nlargest customers through carrying the home shopping network on their cable\\nsystems. \"It\\'s game, set, match,\" said Larry Haverty, a senior vice president\\nof Boston-based State Street Management & Research, which has holdings in\\nComcast. \"QVC is trading dead on $44, and Comcast and Liberty are up.\"  \\n<p>\\n   In Nasdaq Stock Market trading yesterday, QVC closed at $44.25 in heavy\\ntrading, down $1.75, or 3.8%. Comcast Class A stock closed at $16.75, up 87.5\\ncents, or 5.5%, while Liberty Class A shares closed at $21.063, up 81.25 cents,\\nor 4%.  \\n<p>\\n   Larry Gerbrandt, analyst at Paul Kagan Associates, said that with Comcast\\nand Liberty joining forces, \"the sad thing is, we\\'re not going to find out how\\nmuch this thing is really worth -- it\\'s not going to be a true auction.\" The\\nalliance of two cable companies, he adds, proves \"coaxial cable is thicker than\\nwater.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Liberty already owns 80% of the voting stock of Home Shopping Network Inc.,\\nQVC\\'s chief rival. QVC and HSN held merger talks last year, though the deal was\\nabandoned. However, Liberty received regulatory approval to go to as much as a\\n49% stake in QVC, and its share of QVC if the current offer succeeds would\\nstill fall under that level.  \\n<p>\\n   Comcast and Liberty said that QVC and HSN will pursue overseas ventures\\ntogether, but there is no plan to merge the two shopping networks. Neither\\nparty ruled out such a merger in the future, however.  \\n<p>\\n   Liberty agreed to join Comcast after exploring a number of options that\\nincluded trading its QVC stock to Comcast in return for certain Comcast assets,\\na transaction that would have allowed Liberty to avoid paying taxes on any\\ngain. The negotiations took place over the last week when Dennis Hersh, an\\nattorney at Davis Polk & Wardwell representing Comcast, and Steven Rattner,\\nComcast\\'s banker at Lazard Freres, initially approached Liberty\\'s outside\\ncounsel Jerome Kern.  \\n<p>\\n   The agreement to join Comcast was made late Wednesday night and received the\\nblessing of John Malone, chief executive officer of TCI and chairman of\\nLiberty, early yesterday morning. The Comcast advisers then presented the deal\\nto Martin Lipton, who represents QVC, and other QVC advisers in Mr. Lipton\\'s\\noffice. Comcast and Liberty\\'s advisers told the QVC advisers that they did not\\nintend the bid to be coercive and understood that QVC would continue to seek\\nother bidders, but added they would like to expedite the deal to get the cash\\nto QVC holders.  \\n<p>\\n   Brian Roberts, president of Comcast, said yesterday that the Liberty\\nalliance \"enables us to put a stronger bid in front of QVC shareholders\" with a\\n\"strategic\" partner. Because TCI and Liberty carry QVC on their cable systems,\\nMr. Roberts added, \"I couldn\\'t think of a better partner than our best\\ncustomer.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Diller has a 12.5% voting stake in QVC, and is expected to leave QVC\\nafter overseeing its sale, but Liberty officials indicated they are not\\nconcerned about future management under the Roberts family, which controls\\nComcast. \"I think it\\'s about time the Robertses show how good they are at\\nrunning this company,\" said Peter Barton, president of Liberty.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0072 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0213 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2204 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220070 </ACCESN>\\n<PAGE> C1          </PAGE>\\n<GV> G/TRE </GV>\\n<SB> N/BON N/FIN N/FRX N/FXC N/NDQ N/NDX N/STK </SB>\\n<RE> R/EU R/FE R/GE R/JA R/NME R/PRM R/US R/WEU </RE>\\n<ST> S/STT </ST>\\n<HL> Thursday\\'s Markets:  Strong Dollar  Steadies Bonds;  Stocks Inch \\n    Up  ----  By Dave Kansas  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   A surging dollar helped steady the bond market as stocks moved mostly higher\\nin cautious trading.  \\n<p>\\n   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 5.18 to 3732.45, the Standard & Poor\\'s\\n500 Stock Index gained 1.01 to 452.61 and the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced\\n2.26 to 715.03.  \\n<p>\\n   Analysts traced the dollar\\'s rebound to strong rhetorical support from U.S.\\nTreasury Undersecretary Lawrence Summers.

Fares are too high, they say, and direct flights have become rare. \"If\\nyou die here, you have to go through Atlanta to get to heaven or hell,\" they\\njoke.  \\n<p>\\n   Now, South Carolina is trying to buy a better airline. Air South is\\nscheduled to take off next month with the help of $3 million of grants from\\nColumbia and a pledge of $12 million in low-interest loans from the state --\\nbacked by federal housing funds. State officials expect the privately owned\\nairline to link Columbia to a host of new cities and offer lower fares.  \\n<p>\\n   Across the nation, state and city officials are concluding that getting\\ninvolved in local airline service is both good economics and good politics. New\\nJersey put up $1 million to help launch Kiwi International, which flies between\\nNewark and several southern cities. Traverse City, Mich., Amarillo, Texas, and\\nother cities have agreed to make up carriers\\' losses for particular routes.\\nMinnesota and Indiana have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to attract\\nplane-maintenance facilities, partly in hopes of ensuring better airline\\nservice.  \\n<p>\\n   But airline analysts question whether some of these high-flying ventures\\nmake sense. Some analysts, for instance, give Air South little chance of\\nsuccess. \"After everybody in private industry turned them down, they finally\\nfound some suckers in Columbia,\" says Michael Boyd, president of Aviation\\nSystems Research Corp., a consulting firm in Colorado. \"Cities should not be\\ninvolved in the airline business.\" (Air South says its plans are sound.)  \\n<p>\\n   While local politicians have long supported aviation as a key to economic\\ndevelopment, they are convinced that details -- such as whether an airport has\\njets or propeller planes, whether the flights are nonstop and how much the\\nfares are -- can spell the difference between boom and bust. Dallas/Fort Worth\\nInternational Airport, for example, says the number of Japanese companies\\noperating in the area has quadrupled since American Airlines launched direct\\nservice to Japan in 1987.  \\n<p>\\n   Of course, airline deregulation hasn\\'t treated all cities so well. Airlines\\nkeep dropping routes to cut costs; just this week, AMR Corp.\\'s American\\nAirlines said it would cease jet service to Lubbock, Texas, and Trans World\\nAirlines said it would stop commuter service to Syracuse, N.Y., Portland,\\nMaine, and a host of other Northeast cities.  \\n<p>\\n   \"There is a really high level of dissatisfaction among small and midsize\\ncities,\" says George Doughty, executive director of Pennsylvania\\'s\\nAllentown-Bethlehem-Easton International Airport, which lost passengers as\\nnearby Newark gained lower fares. The Allentown airport recently put up\\n$600,000 to persuade TWA to start service to St. Louis through Baltimore -- and\\nto set its fares at just $10 above the low Baltimore fares. \"Communities, when\\nthey get stuck, are resorting to local initiatives to see if they can make it\\nbetter,\" Mr. Doughty says.  \\n<p>\\n   One state, Hawaii, is even trying to turn back the clock on deregulation.\\nThe Legislature last year passed a bill to create an island version of the\\nCivil Aeronautics Board, the federal agency that, until it was abolished in\\n1978, decided how much airlines could charge and where they could fly.\\nProponents say the regulation bill will ensure that citizens of smaller islands\\nsuch as Lanai aren\\'t left stranded if Hawaii\\'s weak local airlines falter and a\\nmainland carrier moves in.  \\n<p>\\n   Hawaii will need congressional approval before it can start regulating, and\\nthe Clinton administration is lobbying against the measure, citing fears that\\nother states would follow suit. Still, Sen. Daniel Inouye (D., Hawaii), tacked\\nthe Hawaii regulation onto a bill passed by the Senate last month.  \\n<p>\\n   Even if Congress drops the language during a coming House-Senate conference,\\nthe Senate bill has two other measures that could increase states\\' influence\\nover airlines: One section requires airlines to notify communities 60 days\\nbefore terminating service. Another gives adjacent states the right to add\\ntheir two cents to discussions on whether to fund big new airports.  \\n<p>\\n   Many airlines aren\\'t too thrilled to have city and state officials playing\\nairline managers. USAir filed a complaint with the Federal Aviation\\nAdministration over the Allentown-TWA deal, saying other airlines were paying\\nwith higher landing fees for an unfair subsidy. USAir and Delta Air Lines both\\nwrote letters protesting the Air South arrangement to South Carolina Gov.\\nCarroll Campbell, a conservative Republican who generally opposes government\\nactivism. He defended the plan.  \\n<p>\\n   \"We\\'re not objecting to a new airline, but what we expect is a level playing\\nfield,\" says Gregg Plotner, Delta\\'s district sales manager in Columbia. \"We\\nstarted in Columbia 60 years ago, and nobody gave Delta or its competitors any\\nstart-up money.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Patrick O\\'Shea, chief executive of Air South, insists the state\\'s backing of\\nhis airline is no different from its support for a new automobile or\\npharmaceutical plant. \"This is a job-creation program. I wouldn\\'t want you to\\nthink it\\'s anything else,\" he says.  \\n<p>\\n   Columbia boosters clearly think Mr. O\\'Shea\\'s airline is much more, though.\\n\"It\\'s an investment in better air service,\" says Mark Simmons, an economic\\ndevelopment official in Columbia.  \\n<p>\\n   For years, the city\\'s business leaders had flown around the country trying\\nto persuade United Airlines, Southwest Airlines and others that Columbia was a\\ngrowing market. \"Everybody was very cordial,\" but the city got fewer direct\\nflights rather than more, says Tommy Suggs, a banker and former local football\\nhero who led the delegations.  \\n<p>\\n   Meanwhile, Mr. O\\'Shea, a travel-industry veteran, was looking for an\\n\"underserved\" part of the country to start a small no-frills airline. When he\\nand Air South\\'s other founders went to Columbia late last year to consider it\\nas a destination, civic leaders tried to persuade them to expand the airline\\nand put its headquarters in the city.  \\n<p>\\n   \"We had to throw something creative and enticing to get someone to come\\nhere,\" Mr. Suggs says. \"We\\'re not Atlanta. We\\'re not Dallas.\" But Columbia is\\nin South Carolina, a state that worried enough about airline service that it\\nhad agreed to raise $50 million in the 1980s to help any airline build a local\\nhub. (There were no takers.)  \\n<p>\\n   Dennis Gabriel, a South Carolina Commerce Department official, found a novel\\nway to give the airline public assistance: using federal Housing and Urban\\nDevelopment Department money that had been pledged to two South Carolina\\ncounties. HUD wouldn\\'t challenge the idea as long as most of the airline\\'s 700\\njobs went to low and moderate-income people. The state also threw in $1.1\\nmillion in grants to train pilots and other workers, and the Air South founders\\nmatched their own $1 million of equity with investments from South Carolina\\nresidents. By April, the state had so big a role in setting up Air South\\'s\\nfinances that the airline hired Mr. Gabriel as its chief financial officer.  \\n<p>\\n   For all its efforts on Air South\\'s behalf, though, the state doesn\\'t have\\nmuch assurance that Columbia\\'s air service will actually improve. Air South\\nsays it will add flights to more cities, but its only formal promise to South\\nCarolina is that it will try to fly to Myrtle Beach.  \\n<p>\\n   A few states have been able to persuade airlines to keep flying such routes\\nwithout subsidies. But, in general, \"the track record is terrible,\" says\\nPatrick Murphy, acting assistant secretary for aviation and international\\naffairs at the U.S. Transportation Department.  \\n<p>\\n   South Dakota, for example, started paying a regional airline to fly among\\neight cities in 1991. But the airline, called Wings of South Dakota, got\\none-third the expected number of passengers, and the state pulled the plug\\nafter six months. Richard Howard, South Dakota\\'s transportation secretary, says\\nprivate airlines are still flying a few routes that are profitable. But the\\nstate had to include smaller cities, such as Yankton (population 12,703) and\\nHuron (population 12,448) to get the Legislature\\'s support.  \\n<p>\\n   \"We got caught in the politics of the whole situation,\" Mr. Howard says.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0074 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0213 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2254 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220072 </ACCESN>\\n<PAGE> A1          </PAGE>\\n<IN> I/FOD I/HEA </IN>\\n<SB> N/HLT N/LIF N/TRG </SB>\\n<MS> M/NCY </MS>\\n<RE> R/NME R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Dying for Milk:  Some Mothers, Trying  In Vain to Breast-Feed,  \\n    Starve Their Infants  ---  `Yuppie Syndrome\\' Among  Well-Meaning \\n    Parents  Stems From Bad Advice  ---  A Generation of Perfectionists \\n     ----  By Kevin Helliker  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   After giving birth to a son last year, Pam Floyd did as most every book and\\nphysician advises these days: She put him to her breast.  \\n<p>\\n   But he didn\\'t seem to get much milk. Discharged from the hospital 24 hours\\nafter his birth, Mrs. Floyd made frantic calls back to the maternity ward, to\\nthe private office of her pediatrician and to a breast-feeding consultant. All\\ngave the same advice, she says: Keep breast-feeding. Don\\'t turn to formula.  \\n<p>\\n   Six days after his birth last year, her son, Chaz, suffered what his\\nneurologist calls dehydration-induced brain damage. \"It is irreversible,\" says\\nthe neurologist, Larry White of Norfolk, Va. \"The lack of milk those first few\\ndays means that Chaz will never lead a normal life.\"  \\n<p>\\n   These days, seemingly everyone is telling new mothers to breast-feed.\\nObstetricians, pediatricians, nurses, government officials and baby-care books\\nare touting the wonders of breast milk, and good thing: Study after study has\\nshown that breast-fed babies are less likely than bottle-fed babies to suffer\\nfrom diarrhea, allergy, infection or other ailments. Even makers of formula are\\nprefacing their advertising with the message that breast milk is best.  \\n<p>\\n   But in their zeal to promote mothers\\' milk, these experts neglect to warn\\nmothers that breast-fed babies sometimes don\\'t get enough milk. Much of the\\nliterature expressly advises new mothers not to worry about this, telling them\\nthey shouldn\\'t resort to formula lest their babies refuse to return to breast\\nmilk. \"Any thought of giving a bottle of formula should be postponed for at\\nleast a couple of weeks\" after birth, says the nation\\'s best-known parenting\\nbook, \"Dr. Spock\\'s Baby and Child Care,\" in a breast-feeding section called \"Is\\nBaby Getting Enough?\"  \\n<p>\\n   This unqualified encouragement to breast-feed is taking a toll. Days-old\\nbabies are returning to hospitals dehydrated and starved. Though the actual\\nnumber of cases is impossible to determine, \"insufficient-milk syndrome\" may\\noccur as much as 5% of the time, affecting about 200,000 mothers a year in the\\nU.S., says Marianne Neifert, a pediatrician at Denver\\'s Presbyterian/St. Luke\\'s\\nHospital who has done studies of the problem.  \\n<p>\\n   Some emergency rooms are reporting dozens of severe cases a year, making\\nthis total possibly above a thousand. And the number is growing rapidly as more\\nand more women breast-feed and as hospitals discharge new mothers sooner and\\nsooner after delivery, sending them home without supervision.  \\n<p>\\n   To recover completely, most infants need only a shot of sustenance,\\nsometimes delivered intravenously because they are too weak to suck a bottle.\\nBut a few cases are grave. In recent weeks, Cincinnati\\'s Children\\'s Hospital\\nMedical Center has admitted two breast-fed infants who were so dehydrated that\\nblood clots had developed, leading to brain damage in one and the amputation of\\na leg in the other. This year in New Jersey and Colorado, dehydration-induced\\ninjuries resulted in the deaths of two breast-fed babies, health officials say.\\n \\n<p>\\n   Despite these infants\\' resemblance to famished poor children, they are often\\nthe offspring of well-to-do professionals, prompting physicians to call this a\\n\"yuppie syndrome.\" Such parents are nearly twice as likely as the poor to\\nbreast-feed their babies because they read so many books and articles on\\nchild-rearing. \"The more intelligence and education the parents have, the\\ngreater the danger seems to be,\" says Nancy Hurst, director of the\\nbreast-feeding program at Texas Children\\'s Hospital in Houston.  \\n<p>\\n   That parents who are determined to give their babies the best of everything\\ncould wind up starving them is testament to the power of the breast-feeding\\nmovement. Its discourses on the marvels of breast-feeding have stirred a\\nreligious-like fervor in many nurses, breast-feeding consultants and volunteers\\nfor La Leche League International, a breast-feeding support group. With the\\nauthority behind them of the U.S. government -- which seeks to raise the\\nnational breast-feeding rate to 75% by 2000, up from 56% last year -- many such\\nwomen are openly critical of mothers who use formula.  \\n<p>\\n   Some advocates praise breast milk and condemn formula beyond any widely\\naccepted scientific findings. \"A bottle-fed baby is likelier to go to prison,\"\\nsays Opal Ordak, a breast-feeding consultant in New Jersey. \"A breast-fed baby\\nis smarter, and as adults they have less rage against their mothers.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Little wonder that breast-feeding failure is difficult for many mothers to\\naccept. Even when a baby\\'s health is threatened in a way that requires a trip\\nto the hospital, \"the mother will often start sobbing, saying she can\\'t bear to\\nsee him get the bottle,\" says Dr. Neifert, the Denver pediatrician. But \"the\\nbaby\\'s eyes will say `Thank you, thank you, thank you\\' when you give him the\\nbottle,\" she adds.  \\n<p>\\n   Some physicians attribute the problem to a generation of perfectionist\\nwomen. \"We\\'re all overachievers, and there\\'s a feeling that if you don\\'t get an\\nA in breast-feeding you\\'ve got an F as a mother,\" says Christine A. Gleason, a\\nmother of three and a neonatologist at Johns Hopkins hospital in Baltimore.  \\n<p>\\n   Wendy Hamilton, 36, wanted intensely to breast-feed. Though she didn\\'t\\nproduce nearly enough milk to feed her infant son, she refused to rely solely\\non formula. Instead, she tried stimulating her milk production by taking\\nmedication and by pumping her breasts whenever her son wasn\\'t latched on. For\\n18 hours a day, she says, she had either the baby or the pump on her breast.\\n\"Forget the laundry, forget grocery shopping, forget everything else,\" says\\nMrs. Hamilton, who was on leave from her job as a human-resources manager in\\nVancouver, British Columbia. \"All I did was breast-feed.\"  \\n<p>\\n   To make matters worse, her son sucked in a terribly painful way.\\n\"Sometimes,\" she says, \"I had blood dripping down my chest and tears streaming\\ndown my face.\"  \\n<p>\\n   She persevered for six weeks -- long enough, she hopes, to pass on the\\ndisease-fighting properties of mother\\'s milk. Still, she is haunted by the\\nprice her baby paid. \"Just the other day I developed a roll of film we shot\\nback then, and it makes me cry,\" she says. \"At three weeks old, he looked like\\nan emaciated fetus.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Of course, even the most passionate support of breast-feeding stems from a\\nconcern for a baby\\'s welfare. \"Nothing is more important than monitoring the\\nhealth of the baby,\" says Mary Ann Cahill, a founder and leader of La Leche.\\nYet at the same time as the medical community is putting more pressure on women\\nto breast-feed, it is offering them little support.  \\n<p>\\n   Until recently, cases of breast-feeding failure often were detected and\\naddressed during an infant\\'s third or fourth day of life by professionals on\\nthe maternity ward. These days, many cost-conscious hospitals are discharging\\nmothers 24 hours after delivery, before some infants are even alert enough to\\ntry feeding. That sends new mothers home with no support or supervision until\\ntheir first pediatrician\\'s visit, typically two weeks later. By then, a baby\\ngetting insufficient breast milk could be near death.  \\n<p>\\n   Of course, any mother worried about insufficient intake could call her\\ndoctor or consult any baby-care book. But she is likely to be told not to worry\\nabout it. \"One of the beauties of breast-feeding is that you need never worry\\nabout how much or how little your baby is taking,\" says one of the most popular\\nparenting books, Workman Publishing\\'s \"What to Expect the First Year.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Similarly, a brochure from La Leche urges mothers to \"give only the breast\\nduring baby\\'s first month,\" adding that \"supplements are not needed to prevent\\ndehydration\" -- even in babies who seem \"uninterested\" in breast-feeding.  \\n<p>\\n   To be sure, maternal anxiety about adequate milk consumption can be\\ngroundless. Unlike intake from bottles, intake from breasts is virtually\\nunmeasurable. On top of that, drawing milk from a breast is more difficult than\\nfrom a bottle, so that mastering the technique can take mother and child a day\\nor two. In nearly all cases, the best way to get over these problems is to\\nfollow the advice of the experts: Relax and stop worrying.  \\n<p>\\n   The difficulty of identifying such infants is increased by the tendency of\\nmany to suffer silently, a phenomenon doctors call \"content to starve.\" \"One\\nbreast-feeding mother called and said what a good, happy baby she had, only he\\nwasn\\'t wetting many diapers,\" says Mary Wisneski, lactation educator at\\nArizona\\'s Samaritan Medical Center in Mesa. Knowing that infants should wet at\\nleast six diapers a day, Ms. Wisneski says she asked to see the baby\\nimmediately, and it turned out that \"the soft spot on his head had sunken\" -- a\\nsign of severe dehydration.  \\n<p>\\n   Some physicians say certain breasts are structurally incapable of producing\\nenough milk; in addition, women who have had breast surgery are at risk. Some\\ninfants, meanwhile, are incapable of learning how to breast-feed.  \\n<p>\\n   Whatever the cause, failure to detect the problem is the fault ultimately of\\nthe medical profession. While both obstetricians and pediatricians strongly\\nencourage women to breast-feed, neither group is trained to take responsibility\\nfor providing care or guidance. During a woman\\'s pregnancy, her obstetrician\\ntypically examines only the fetus. And after delivery, her pediatrician\\ntypically examines only the baby. \"During all my years of training to become a\\npediatrician, I had probably one hour of training in breast-feeding,\" says\\nWendy Slugger of Wellstart International, a San Diego-based agency that offers\\nbreast-feeding training to medical professionals.  \\n<p>\\n   This means that breast-feeding advice and procedure is determined largely by\\nnurses and lay people, such as volunteers for La Leche. And many of these\\nexperts are opposed to any warnings about breast-feeding failure. \"Failure\\noccurs because of lack of confidence,\" says Mrs. Cahill of La Leche.\\n\"Breast-feeding is a mind game -- you have to believe you can.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Physicians calling for greater awareness of the problem worry that it will\\ndiscourage breast-feeding. Breast-feeding is largely eschewed by the\\nunderprivileged. And doctors say that new mothers from every walk of life are\\ntoo quick to give up breast-feeding at the first hint of trouble. Insufficient\\nintake is \"rare and it\\'s catchable and there\\'s no reason it should undermine\\nany mother\\'s plan to breast-feed,\" says Ruth Lawrence, a pediatrician at the\\nUniversity of Rochester Medical Center in New York.  \\n<p>\\n   Closer monitoring of breast-fed babies could solve the problem, doctors say.\\nIn Britain, for example, government midwives visit new mothers\\' homes for two\\nweeks following birth, and quickly identify any babies failing to breast-feed. \\n\\n<p>\\n   Such a program could help eliminate the problem of worried mothers being\\ninstructed to keep breast-feeding and avoid supplementation. This kind of\\nadvice contributed to the death a few days ago of an infant in Denver, says Dr.\\nNeifert. And it also may have played a role in the two recent cases in\\nCincinnati. Extremists \"need to ease up a little,\" says Michael Farrell, chief\\nof staff at Cincinnati\\'s Children\\'s Hospital.  \\n<p>\\n   Pam Floyd would agree. Before she quit her job as a secretary to have her\\nbaby, she and her husband read several books on baby-rearing and decided\\ndefinitively to breast-feed, in part because of studies showing that breast\\nmilk reduces infant susceptibility to allergies. \"Pam and I both have terrible\\nallergies,\" says Frank Floyd, her husband, a clerk at a Food Lion grocery store\\nin Norfolk, Va.  \\n<p>\\n   From the start, their son, Chaz, seemed to have difficulty breast-feeding.\\nBut a nurse at Sentara Lee Hospital advised the Floyds to keep trying and not\\nto supplement with formula. At home on Chaz\\'s third day of life, the Floyds say\\nthey received a visit from a Sentara home-health nurse who weighed the baby and\\ngave the same advice. Later that day, Friday, Mrs. Floyd called Pediatrics\\nAssociates, office of her pediatrician, and says she was told by a nurse there\\nthat Chaz would feed when he got hungry enough.  \\n<p>\\n   On Monday, Chaz\\'s fifth day of life, he still didn\\'t seem to be feeding. So\\nMrs. Floyd called the Sentara nurse as well as the nurse at her pediatrician\\'s\\noffice, and says she was told again to relax, keep trying and avoid\\nsupplementation. She says she was also told that because she was a new mother,\\nshe didn\\'t appreciate how much he was probably getting.  \\n<p>\\n   A Sentara spokeswoman denies that any Sentara nurse advised Mrs. Floyd\\nagainst formula. Robert Fink, a doctor at Pediatrics Associates, says his\\noffice told Mrs. Floyd to come in and she didn\\'t.  \\n<p>\\n   The next morning, dehydration-induced blood clots sent Chaz into convulsions\\nand left him permanently brain damaged. Now, a year later, \"my son doesn\\'t do\\nthe things that children his age do,\" says Mrs. Floyd. \"He doesn\\'t sit up. He\\ndoesn\\'t crawl. And it hurts me to see it.\"  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0076 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0214 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2246 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220073 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> ALDA </CO>\\n<SB> N/ANL N/NDQ N/NDX N/OTC N/STK </SB>\\n<RE> R/NME R/US </RE>\\n<ST> S/STT </ST>\\n<HL> Small Stock Focus:  Technology and Communications Issues  Lead to \\n    Moderate Gains in Late Trading  ----  By Caitlin Mollison  Special \\n    to The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   NEW YORK -- Technology and communications stocks peppered the gainers list,\\nhelping small-company issues move moderately higher in late trading. Financial\\nstocks also rallied after a dismal start.  \\n<p>\\n   The Russell 2000 Index, which charts small-capitalization stocks traded on\\nthe Nasdaq Stock Market and the other major exchanges, rose 0.26, or 0.11%, to\\n243.91, its first advance since last Thursday.  \\n<p>\\n   Nasdaq stocks, as measured by the Composite Index, gained 2.26, or 0.32%, to\\n715.03. Advancing Nasdaq issues sneaked past decliners, 1,553 to 1,533, on\\ntotal volume of 297,466,100 shares. Total volume on Wednesday reached\\n297,629,700 shares.  \\n<p>\\n   Market watchers say the interest-rate watch continued, as did concern over\\ncorporate earnings reports.  \\n<p>\\n   Equities were hurt Wednesday as bonds toppled under the weight of comments\\nby Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. He said it is an \"open question\"\\nwhether the central bank has tightened credit enough to stave off inflation.\\nMr. Greenspan\\'s testimony on Capitol Hill continues today.  \\n<p>\\n   Although stocks did rise a bit, some observers found pessimism still\\nprevalent. \"There\\'s a lot of negative momentum right now,\" said Richard Bruno,\\nhead of Nasdaq trading at PaineWebber Inc. \"We\\'re just watching and waiting.\"  \\n<p>\\n   The main focus in the technology group was impressive second-quarter\\nearnings from International Business Machines Corp., which drove its price up 6\\n1/2 to 62 3/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.  \\n<p>\\n   Smaller computer-related stocks warmly embraced Big Blue\\'s profit report.\\nInmac, a Santa Clara, Calif., distributor of computer accessories zoomed up 3/4\\nto 4 3/4; software designer KnowledgeWare, based in Atlanta, rose 1/2 to 4 1/8,\\nand software developer Ross Systems gained 3/8 to 3 3/8.  \\n<p>\\n   In earnings news, Cerner rocketed 6 7/8, or 27%, to 32. Late Wednesday, the\\nKansas City, Mo., designer of information systems said it earned 33 cents a\\nshare in the second quarter, compared with 23 cents last year. Dean Witter\\nReynolds Inc., Dain Bosworth Inc. and Punk Ziegel & Knoell all raised their\\nratings on Cerner.  \\n<p>\\n   But Gupta, a Menlo Park, Calif., software developer, fell 1 1/4 to 11 15/16.\\nOracle will cut its stake in Gupta to 2.4% from 7.7%, but said merger talks\\nbetween the two are continuing. Oracle eased 1/8 to 37.  \\n<p>\\n   Golden Systems tumbled 1, or 29%, to 2 1/2. The Simi Valley, Calif.,\\ndesigner of switching power supplies for use in personal computers said\\nearnings fell to a penny a share from pro forma net income of 12 cents last\\nyear.  \\n<p>\\n   Communications stocks got a shot in the arm after Liberty Media agreed to\\njoin Comcast in its bid for QVC.  \\n<p>\\n   CableMaxx, an Austin, Texas, developer of wireless cable-television systems,\\njumped 1/2 to 7 1/4, and Interdigital Communications, based in King of Prussia,\\nPa., advanced 1/16 to 3 1/8.  \\n<p>\\n   Disappointing earnings hurt I.I.S. Intelligent Information Systems, which\\nskidded 1 7/8, or 34%, to 3 5/8. The Israeli communications networking company\\nsaid second-quarter earnings were just four cents a share, down from 35 cents a\\nyear earlier.  \\n<p>\\n   Digital Microwave shot up 3 3/8 to 15 1/4. The San Jose, Calif., company\\nsaid first-quarter earnings rose to 14 cents a share from one cent last year.  \\n<p>\\n   X-Rite climbed 3 3/8 to 28 1/2. The Grandville, Mich., maker of\\nelectro-optical devices reported second-quarter earnings of 31 cents a share, a\\nsharp improvement from the 17 cents earned a year earlier.  \\n<p>\\n   Resound gained 1 3/8 to 7 5/8. The Redwood City, Calif., designer of hearing\\ndevices posted net income of seven cents a share, matching analysts\\' estimates\\nand outdoing last year\\'s profit by two cents a share.  \\n<p>\\n   Credit Acceptance, Southfield, Mich., surged 4 5/8 to a 52-week high of 28\\n3/8 after posting second-quarter earnings of 23 cents a share late Wednesday,\\nabove the 15 cents reported last year. The company provides services to\\nautomobile dealers.  \\n<p>\\n   An Alex. Brown & Sons Inc. rating downgrade sliced 2 1/4 from Aldila\\'s stock\\nprice, sending it to 13. Analyst Christopher Feiss was said to have cut the\\nrating on the San Diego designer of graphite golf shafts, but he was on\\nvacation and couldn\\'t be reached to comment. Late Wednesday, Aldila posted\\nsecond-quarter earnings of 22 cents a share, compared with operating net of 18\\ncents last year. Wall Street had expected earnings of about 21 cents.  \\n<p>\\n   \"Right now, there\\'s a lot of concern about which way the Fed is going,\" said\\nSatya D. Pradhuman, vice president and senior quantitative analyst at Merrill\\nLynch & Co. Investors are trying to gauge whether the central bank will move to\\nraise interest rates for the fifth time this year. They hope Mr. Greenspan\\'s\\ntestimony today may provide further clues.  \\n<p>\\n   Although Mr. Pradhuman said rate worries aren\\'t necessarily overshadowing\\nthe earnings flow, \"concerns have been raised about the valuation of people\\'s\\ninvestments.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Inflation and interest-rate fears have hit smaller growth stocks hard, to\\nthe tune of about 11% for the year to date, according to Mr. Pradhuman. Value\\nissues, on the other hand, have fared slightly better, falling about 6%. Growth\\ninvestors look for stocks with superior earnings potential, while value players\\nbuy stocks whose prices are beaten down relative to earnings and other\\nfundamentals.  \\n<p>\\n   Technology issues, prime members of the growth category, have corrected to\\nsuch a degree that they are poised for a \"nice rebound,\" Mr. Pradhuman said.\\nBut any upturn in rates causes alarm about the effect on future earnings, which\\ncould continue to hurt the technology sector.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0077 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0214 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2334 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220074 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> DI TRW </CO>\\n<IN> I/DTC I/EQS I/OIE I/PET </IN>\\n<SB> N/PET N/WEI </SB>\\n<MS> M/ENE M/TEC </MS>\\n<RE> R/NME R/OH R/TX R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Business Brief -- TRW Inc.:  Company to Supply Valves,  Roto Caps \\n    to Dresser Unit </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   Cleveland-based TRW Inc. said it has signed a five-year supply agreement\\nwith Dresser Industries Inc., Dallas, Texas, to provide a unit of that company\\nwith 100% of its valve train requirements.  \\n<p>\\n   Financial terms weren\\'t disclosed.  \\n<p>\\n   According to the agreement, the company\\'s Valve Division will supply all of\\nthe Waukesha Engine Division\\'s valves and roto caps through 1999, TRW said.  \\n<p>\\n   The Dresser division makes natural-gas engines serving the petroleum, power\\ngeneration and municipal markets.

Laurance Fuller, Amoco\\'s chairman and chief executive officer. Mr.\\nFuller noted that it was only two years ago, not long after he took office,\\nthat Amoco eliminated 8,500 jobs. The two massive cutbacks added together are\\nthe equivalent of reducing Amoco\\'s employment by nearly one quarter.  \\n<p>\\n   Oil companies have been laying off workers and revamping operations for more\\nthan a decade now, and the initiatives seem to come in waves. In recent weeks\\nAtlantic Richfield Co., Texaco Inc. and Mobil Corp. all unveiled restructurings\\nthat entail staff cuts totaling 6,800 oil workers. By some counts the domestic\\noil industry has lost 500,000 oil jobs over the past decade or so.  \\n<p>\\n   The list of other companies at varying stages of overhauls reads like a\\nWho\\'s Who of Big Oil across the globe: Elf Aquitaine Co. in Paris, British\\nPetroleum Co. in London and the oil company subsidiary of Ente Nazionale\\nIdrocarburi in Rome, among others.  \\n<p>\\n   The chief cause is flat or lower prices for the industry\\'s main commodities:\\ncrude oil, natural gas, gasoline and other petroleum products, and for many\\ncompanies, chemicals. Like Amoco, much of the industry is going through its\\nthird, fourth or fifth cutback in an effort to boost profits without any\\nexpectation of getting help from rising commodity prices.  \\n<p>\\n   \"There was a period of time in the oil business that some people were\\nconvinced that prices would turn back around dramatically,\" Mr. Fuller said in\\nan interview. \"We\\'ve come to the conclusion we can\\'t count on increases in oil\\nprices.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Because of industry efforts to contain costs, and expectations of a cyclical\\nincrease in profit margins, James Murchie, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &\\nCo. in New York, predicts that earnings of the group of major oil companies he\\nfollows will rise 10% to 15% in 1995 over this year\\'s profit. He sees a similar\\nincrease in 1996. Many analysts are more optimistic.  \\n<p>\\n   Based in Chicago, Amoco said it will take a second-quarter charge of $256\\nmillion to cover severance payments and costs related to the closing and sale\\nof certain facilities. Amoco will incur an additional $200 million of costs\\nthrough 1996 reflecting system redesign, relocations, consolidations and\\ndevelopment of new processes. For the 1993 second quarter, Amoco earned $487\\nmillion, or 98 cents a share, on revenue of $7.23 billion.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Fuller said the company will achieve $600 milion of annual cost savings\\nfrom the latest restructuring, on top of cost reductions of $600 million from\\nthe 1992 layoffs.  \\n<p>\\n   The overall thrust of Amoco\\'s plan hasn\\'t been a secret, although the\\ndetails were. Since March, Amoco\\'s stock has risen from a low of $50.875 a\\nshare, as investors anticipated the news. In composite trading on the New York\\nStock Exchange yesterday, the shares dropped $1.50 to $59.625.  \\n<p>\\n   Amoco said it will eliminate 3,800 jobs in the next 12 months, 2,000 of\\nwhich will be support staff. An additional 700 jobs will be eliminated by the\\nend of 1996, the company said, bringing the total of lost jobs to 4,500. Amoco\\nsaid 1,300 jobs cut will be lost in Chicago, 1,100 in Houston, 400 in Tulsa,\\nOkla., and the rest scattered throughout its empire. The company declined to be\\nmore specific.  \\n<p>\\n   The cost-cutting benefit from layoffs is only half the equation, Mr. Fuller\\nsaid. Amoco is also revamping a corporate structure that dates back to Mr.\\nFuller\\'s feisty predecessor at Amoco in the 1960s, John Swearingen.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Swearingen pulled together various companies within Amoco to form three\\nmajor subsidiaries: an exploration and production company that searches for oil\\nand gas and then pumps it out of the ground and sells it; a refining and\\nmarketing company that buys crude oil, turns it into gasoline and other\\npetroleum products and markets through Amoco service stations; and a chemical\\ncompany that processes crude oil into a variety of products for sale.  \\n<p>\\n   These three main subsidiaries are the mainstay operating companies at most\\nother big oil companies, from Exxon Corp., the country\\'s largest, down the\\nline.  \\n<p>\\n   As of July 1, Amoco eliminated its three main subsidiaries and replaced them\\nwith 17 business groups that attempt to be more streamlined and\\ncustomer-focused. In the past, each subsidiary had a president, vice presidents\\nand a large staff that included planning, accounting and public affairs, for\\ninstance. \"That was a layer of review and bureaucracy that we\\'re eliminating,\"\\nMr. Fuller said.  \\n<p>\\n   Each business unit has its own growth target, determines its own spending\\nbudget and how to allocate the funds. \"We\\'re making it clear that the business\\nunit has responsibility and authority for its profit performance,\" Mr. Fuller\\nsaid.  \\n<p>\\n   Other big oil companies have formed business units in an effort to create\\nmore responsibility and authority lower down in the organization. But none has\\ntaken it as far as Amoco. \"I don\\'t know of a major competitor that has\\neliminated the subsidiary company layer,\" Mr. Fuller said.  \\n<p>\\n   The heads of each business unit will report directly to Amoco\\'s strategic\\nplanning committee, its senior management team. The committee includes Mr.\\nFuller, the former heads of the three subsidiaries who are now called sector\\nexecutives, two vice chairmen, the chief financial officer and three other\\nofficers.  \\n<p>\\n   Seven business units will replace the exploration and production subsidiary.\\nThe units include U.S. operations, Canadian operations, natural gas, world-wide\\nexploration and technology unit. Four units will replace the refining and\\nmarketing subsidiary, each responsible for a stage of petroleum movement from\\nits acquisition to refining to marketing to business development. Six units\\nhave been formed to replace the chemical subsidiary.  \\n<p>\\n   \"I see a renewed company where making a decision quickly and decisively is\\nmore important than having it reviewed at many levels of bureaucracy,\" Mr.\\nFuller said.  \\n<p>\\n   While decentralizing much of the company, Mr. Fuller is also consolidating\\nmany activities in a group called shared services, whose head also sits on the\\nstrategic planning committee. Organized geographically, with sites planned in\\nHouston, Atlanta and Chicago, for instance, shared services will consist of\\nsupport staff working for all the business units in its turf.  \\n<p>\\n   Support staff would include such functions as human resources, government\\naffairs and health, environment and safety. Mr. Fuller hopes the new setup will\\ngain efficiencies and increase the support staff\\'s \"partnership\" with line\\noperations.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0080 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0214 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2248 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220077 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> G.MMW </CO>\\n<IN> I/FAC </IN>\\n<GV> G/IGV </GV>\\n<SB> N/LAW N/MNT </SB>\\n<MS> M/IDU </MS>\\n<RE> R/EU R/GE R/WEU </RE>\\n<HL> German Executive Battles to Clear Name  ---  Mannesmann Chairman \\n    Ends Career  Amid Charge of Wrongdoing  ----  By Audrey Choi  Staff \\n    Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   DUESSELDORF, Germany -- These were supposed to be Werner Dieter\\'s easy,\\ngolden days after 34 years of hard work at one of Germany\\'s largest and most\\nprestigious companies.  \\n<p>\\n   But instead of resting on his laurels, former Mannesmann AG Chairman Dieter\\nis fighting to protect his name from allegations he used his position at the\\nconglomerate to line his own pockets.  \\n<p>\\n   \"The accusations are perverse and absolutely absurd,\" says Mr. Dieter, the\\nfurrowed lines in his gaunt face deepening, as he discusses the allegations of\\nwrongdoing in an interview just a few days after retiring as Mannesmann\\nchairman.  \\n<p>\\n   \"The most infuriating part is that this defamation is coming in part from\\npeople whose jobs I created. The very chairs they are sitting on are only there\\nbecause I built up that business,\" snaps the 64-year-old industrialist.  \\n<p>\\n   Indeed, until just a few weeks ago, Mr. Dieter was widely acknowledged as a\\ntough but respected manager, responsible for a strategic expansion of\\nMannesmann, diversifying the traditional steel pipe and machinery concern into\\npromising new areas such as advanced engineering and the rapidly expanding\\nmobile telephone industry. Famous as a driven workaholic, Mr. Dieter routinely\\nworked 18-hour days, six days a week. \"Except on Sundays -- then I let myself\\nsleep in until 11,\" he says. Mannesmann stock is now viewed as well-positioned\\nto benefit from a recovery and is a strong \"buy\" on most analysts\\' lists.  \\n<p>\\n   But a mid-June cover story in the German magazine Der Spiegel clouded that\\npicture, and initially jolted the stock, by raising allegations of three\\ndecades of self-serving dealings by Mr. Dieter. According to Der Spiegel, Mr.\\nDieter systematically used his position as a top manager to force the company\\'s\\nhydraulics unit Mannesmann Rexroth to buy parts, often at severely inflated\\nprices, from the Hydac Gruppe -- a group of companies co-founded and partially\\nowned by none other than Mr. Dieter. An iron-fisted manager, Mr. Dieter toiled\\nfor Mannesmann, but also bullied employees into tossing generous deals in\\nHydac\\'s direction, Spiegel says.  \\n<p>\\n   Coming on the heels of a number of spectacular scandals that have shaken\\ncorporate Germany in recent months such as the near-bankruptcy of\\nMetallgesellschaft AG and the collapse of the Juergen Schneider AG construction\\nempire, the allegations surrounding Mr. Dieter have triggered renewed concern\\nover corruption percolating in the cozy world of German corporate board rooms. \\n\\n<p>\\n   In response to the allegations raised, public prosecutors in Duesseldorf,\\nwhere Mannesmann is based, recently opened investigations into possible fraud\\nby Mr. Dieter. Mannesmann\\'s own supervisory board has commissioned a special\\ninvestigation by external auditors to sift through the details of the\\n31-year-long relationship between Mr. Dieter, Hydac and Rexroth. (Publicly held\\nGerman corporations are run by a two-tier system in which a supervisory board\\nis charged with monitoring the activities of the management board, which is\\nresponsible for the day-to-day operations of the company.)  \\n<p>\\n   But Mr. Dieter bristles at the suggestion that the allegations against him\\nwarrant even the remotest comparison to cases like MG or Schneider. While those\\nsituations left trails of billions of dollars of debt and endangered thousands\\nof jobs, \"this is a tale of industrial history, of an unparalleled success --\\nnot an evil tale of losses and corruption,\" Mr. Dieter insists. \"We didn\\'t\\ncheat anybody. We did something. We built something. I built something,\" he\\nsaid.  \\n<p>\\n   In 1960, when Mr. Dieter joined Rexroth, then a private company until\\nacquired by Mannesmann, the company employed only 200 people producing 10\\nmillion marks ($6.5 million) in annual sales. Today, the Mannesmann Rexroth\\ndivision employs 16,000, with annual sales topping three billion marks. Hydac,\\nco-founded in 1963 by Mr. Dieter and the Rexroth family, meanwhile, now has\\n1,300 employees and 260 million marks in annual turnover, Mr. Dieter notes with\\npride. Lawyer\\'s View But Ralph Westerhoff, a corporate lawyer at Westerhoff,\\nKaufmann Lutz in Munich, says the fact that both companies have done well\\nwouldn\\'t be an exoneration of wrongdoing.  \\n<p>\\n   \"Legally, the decisive point is only whether Mr. Dieter used his position as\\nchairman of Mannesmann to the disadvantage of Mannesmann and the benefit of\\nHydac. If this was so, the profit of Mannesmann possibly could have been even\\nbigger and the economic success of Hydac somewhat smaller,\" he said.  \\n<p>\\n   But Mr. Dieter insists it\\'s all a dust storm, packaged as a sensationalist\\npress campaign to discredit him at the end of his career. According to Mr.\\nDieter, an anonymous letter last November warned that if Mannesmann proposed to\\nelect Mr. Dieter as supervisory board chairman at the July 8 shareholders\\nmeeting, a press campaign would be started against him. The first Spiegel\\narticle about Mr. Dieter was published one month before that shareholder\\'s\\nmeeting, followed up by two further articles in the following weeks. As a\\nconsequence of the unresolved allegations, Mr. Dieter was elected to the\\nsupervisory board after hefty debate, but not named its chairman as had been\\nplanned.  \\n<p>\\n   An infuriated Mr. Dieter has asked three separate law firms whether he can\\ntake action against Spiegel for slander or defamation of character. But \"the\\narticle is so excellently written, weaving together half-truths and anonymous\\nassertions, that there\\'s nothing I can do,\" Mr. Dieter says with exasperation. \\n\\n<p>\\n   Legal experts on issues of economic crime said that if the allegations in\\nSpiegel are correct and can be proven, criminal charges of fraud can\\'t be ruled\\nout. But it could be hard to get such charges to stick, lawyers said. To pursue\\nfraud charges, there must be firm evidence of clear economic damage sustained\\nby the company, noted Ralf Rizzi, a criminal law specialist at the corporate\\nlaw firm Mangel & Partner in Leverkusen, Germany.  \\n<p>\\n   \"It will be incredibly difficult to present water-tight proof of such harm,\\nbecause there is always a subjective angle involved. One can say the quality or\\nreliability of a supplier justified paying higher prices. And if you can\\'t\\nprove economic damage, you can\\'t prosecute,\" he said.  \\n<p>\\n   Particularly because the laws in Germany over conflict-of-interest are much\\nvaguer than in the U.S., much more is left to the personal discretion of the\\nindividuals involved, legal experts noted. The \"blind trust\" construction in\\nthe U.S. designed to prevent a manager of one company from exerting influence\\non a private company holding doesn\\'t exist in Germany. And privately owning a\\ncompany that does business with the corporation one runs is deemed a conflict\\nof interest only if the relationship is abused to the detriment of the\\ncorporation. Consequently, a discussion of changing ethics and corporate\\nculture in Germany over the past 30 years may be as important a part of the\\nstory as where the legal lines are drawn.  \\n<p>\\n   \"It may turn out to be less an issue over criminal wrongdoing and more one\\nover an insufficient awareness of what\\'s ethically and morally acceptable,\"\\nsaid Oliver Habel, a competition lawyer in Munich.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0081 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0215 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2333 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220078 </ACCESN>\\n<IN> I/BNK I/SCR </IN>\\n<GV> G/FDC G/FDL G/FED G/THS G/TRE </GV>\\n<SB> N/ACC N/CBK N/MOR </SB>\\n<MS> M/FIN </MS>\\n<RE> R/NME R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Bank Regulators Agree  On CMO Accounting Rules  ----  Special to \\n    The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   NEW YORK -- Federal bank regulators reached a compromise with the Financial\\nAccounting Standards Board on how banks should treat collateralized mortgage\\nobligations, or CMOs, on their balance sheets.  \\n<p>\\n   CMOs, which are mortgage-backed securities whose maturities and risks vary,\\nare popular investments for U.S. banks. The compromise between bank regulators\\nand the FASB, the chief rulemaking body for accountants, ends a months-long\\nimpasse.  \\n<p>\\n   Under the agreement, bank regulators won\\'t force banks and thrifts to sell\\nCMOs that are considered risky unless the securities threaten the \"safety and\\nsoundness\" of the institution, according to officials who attended a meeting of\\nthe FASB and bank regulators. But regulators still could require banks to move\\nrisky CMOs from a hold-to-maturity account to a hold-for-sale account.  \\n<p>\\n   Such a shift would force the banks to value the securities at their current\\nmarket value, rather than at cost, which would affect the bank\\'s capital. If\\nbanks were forced to sell the CMOs immediately, however, it would affect bank\\nprofits.  \\n<p>\\n   The regulatory agencies that agreed to the compromise are the Federal\\nReserve, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision and\\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. A fifth agency, the National Credit Union\\nAdministration, declined to participate in the compromise, officials said.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0082 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0215 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2228 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220079 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> DGP MRO X </CO>\\n<IN> I/OIS I/PET I/PIP I/STL </IN>\\n<SB> N/ANL N/ERN N/HIY N/PET </SB>\\n<MS> M/BSC M/ENE </MS>\\n<RE> R/NME R/PA R/TX R/US </RE>\\n<HL> USX Swung to a Second-Quarter Profit  On Strength in Oil and Steel \\n    Businesses  ----  By Erle Norton  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street \\n    Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   PITTSBURGH -- USX Corp., profiting from surging steel demand and a big gain\\nat its oil unit, earned $107 million in the second quarter compared with a loss\\nof $314 million a year ago.  \\n<p>\\n   Sales at USX, an oil, steel and natural-gas concern, increased 4% to $4.82\\nbillion from $4.65 billion in 1993\\'s second quarter.  \\n<p>\\n   USX\\'s sharply improved performance was spurred by its U.S. Steel Group,\\nwhich posted stronger earnings than analysts expected. The group reported net\\nincome of $56 million, or 65 cents a share. Analysts had expected the nation\\'s\\nbiggest steelmaker to earn 47 cents a share. In 1993\\'s second quarter, U.S.\\nSteel posted a loss of $336 million, or $5.71 a share. That included net\\nafter-tax charges of $349 million from antitrust litigation and environmental\\ncontingencies.  \\n<p>\\n   U.S. Steel\\'s second-quarter sales climbed 8% to $1.53 billion from $1.43\\nbillion.  \\n<p>\\n   Still, some analysts considered the steel unit\\'s earnings disappointing,\\nconsidering the nation\\'s healthy demand for steel. \"It was a good quarter, but\\nU.S. Steel has a long way to go,\" said Thomas M. Van Leeuwen, an analyst with\\nCS First Boston.  \\n<p>\\n   The earnings were tempered by planned outages of a hot-strip mill at its\\nGary, Ind., plant. Gary Works also had an outage at a pickling line, which\\ncleans steel. The outages forced U.S. Steel to sell more nonprime, or\\nlower-quality, steel, which carries lower prices, Mr. Van Leeuwen said.  \\n<p>\\n   In a statement, Charles A. Corry, USX\\'s chairman, noted that the hot-strip\\nmill modernization, which forced outages, should be completed by mid-August. He\\nforecast continued strong demand.  \\n<p>\\n   \"Our order book remains very healthy and we will benefit from further price\\nimprovement with the base price increases on most products which took effect in\\nJuly,\" he said.  \\n<p>\\n   Meanwhile, USX\\'s Marathon Group earned $72 million, or 25 cents a share,\\ncompared with $21 million, or seven cents a share, a year earlier. The most\\nrecent quarter\\'s results were bolstered by a net after-tax gain of $67 million,\\nwhich included an inventory market-valuation adjustment. The oil company\\'s\\nyear-ago period included an unfavorable inventory market valuation adjustment\\nof $29 million.  \\n<p>\\n   Sales in the quarter rose 2% to $3.16 billion from $3.1 billion.  \\n<p>\\n   Robin Shoemaker, an oil industry analyst with Lehman Brothers, said that\\nexcluding nonoperating items, Marathon earned about one cent a share. Crude-oil\\nprices soared about 40% in the quarter, but gasoline and other petroleum\\nproduct prices didn\\'t rise nearly as fast, squeezing profit margins. \"Quarterly\\nearnings from refining and marketing were the lowest in probably three or four\\nyears,\" Mr. Shoemaker said.  \\n<p>\\n   USX\\'s natural-gas unit, Delhi Group, posted a second quarter-loss of $31.6\\nmillion, or $2.27 a share, compared with net income of $2.1 million, or 15\\ncents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 6% to $136.2 million from $129\\nmillion in 1993\\'s second quarter.  \\n<p>\\n   The most recent quarter included after-tax charges totaling $28 million for\\nplanned assets disposals and an employee severance program, among other items.\\nThe year-ago quarter included an after-tax gain of $1.1 million relating to a\\nprior acquisition and a resolution of a contract dispute.  \\n<p>\\n   USX said Delhi\\'s results were hobbled by lower gas-sales margins due to\\nreduced premiums from Southwestern Electric Power Co. and lower average spreads\\non spot-market sales. Delhi also had low average sales prices and gross profit\\nmargins for natural-gas liquids, such as propane and butane.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0083 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0215 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2250 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220080 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> T.FL </CO>\\n<IN> I/NFR I/ONF </IN>\\n<SB> N/INI N/REG N/STK </SB>\\n<MS> M/BSC </MS>\\n<RE> R/CN R/NME R/ONT </RE>\\n<HL> Falconbridge Ltd.

But instead of seeking its use in computers as well, he said,\\nthe administration will conduct a five-month study to develop a new encryption\\nplan that will satisfy both private industry and government agencies. He added\\nthat the new system would be voluntary, won\\'t rely on a classified computer\\nencryption formula and would be exportable, all key demands of industry.  \\n<p>\\n   The move follows vociferous complaints from computer and other high-tech\\ncompanies, which said the Clipper Chip technology would allow the NSA to\\nintercept their communications. They also worried that having to use the NSA\\ntechnology would limit computer exports because the government might prohibit\\nforeign sales of the technology and, even if exports were allowed, foreign\\nbuyers might not want devices that included it.  \\n<p>\\n   The vice president\\'s comments came in a letter to Rep. Maria Cantwell, (D.,\\nWash.), whose district includes software giant Microsoft Corp. The letter was\\nreported in yesterday\\'s Washington Post and New York Times.  \\n<p>\\n   Clipper Chip technology generally refers to a group of projects undertaken\\nby the NSA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology in 1989. The\\ngoal was to protect computer and telephone communications from eavesdropping.\\nBut the government would hold keys to decode communications.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Gore said the administration is now willing to allow private companies\\nto hold the keys, too. That\\'s intended to allay fears that the government would\\nuse the keys illegally to listen in on conversations or data transmissions.  \\n<p>\\n   Prior to the Clipper Chip controversy, the NSA had made other moves to\\npersuade private industry to adopt its encryption technology. They all flopped\\nbecause of fears of possible NSA surveillance and determined opposition by\\nprivate companies.  \\n<p>\\n   Jerry Berman, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation,\\nbelieves the same fate is likely for Clipper, in part because of its limited\\nuse. The foundation is an industry lobby group.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0085 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0215 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 0002 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220082 </ACCESN>\\n<IN> I/HEA I/INL I/INS </IN>\\n<GV> G/CNG G/EXE </GV>\\n<SB> N/HCP N/HLT N/LAB N/LAW N/SML </SB>\\n<MS> M/FIN M/NCY </MS>\\n<RE> R/NME R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Politics & Policy:  Top Democrats  Are Completing  2 Health Bills \\n     ---  House and Senate Will Get  Separate Measures; Both  To Vary \\n    From Clinton\\'s  ----  By Jeffrey H. Birnbaum and Hilary Stout  Staff \\n    Reporters of The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   WASHINGTON -- Democratic congressional leaders, seeking to distance\\nthemselves from President Clinton\\'s tarnished health-care plan, are nearing\\ncompletion of their own bills that would achieve universal coverage more slowly\\nand with less regulation.  \\n<p>\\n   In preparation for the unveiling of separate House and Senate bills by the\\nend of the month, Mr. Clinton discussed strategy last night with Senate\\nMajority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine), House Speaker Thomas Foley (D.,\\nWash.) and House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.). The White House\\nmeeting, which lasted for more than an hour, was also attended by Hillary\\nRodham Clinton, who is the president\\'s top adviser on health care, and Vice\\nPresident Al Gore.  \\n<p>\\n   Speaking with reporters after the session, the congressional leaders made a\\npoint of saying they would produce bills that were different in many ways than\\nthe president\\'s own proposal, which has been roundly criticized by a variety of\\ninterests and has plummeted in public opinion polls.  \\n<p>\\n   \"We all came to the conclusion we needed to approach the legislation in a\\nnew spirit,\" said Speaker Foley.  \\n<p>\\n   The lawmakers and White House aides said the House and Senate would produce\\nbills that were different from each other, but provided few details. They said,\\nhowever, that both pieces of legislation would follow the same set of\\nprinciples that they hashed out with the president during the meeting.  \\n<p>\\n   Most important, they said, the bills that go to the floors of the House and\\nSenate would extend health coverage to all Americans. But they said the\\nlegislation would be less bureaucratic than the original White House plan and\\nbe phased in over a longer period than the Clinton bill, which sought to\\nachieve universal coverage by 1998.  \\n<p>\\n   The other principles outlined by the Democratic leaders were: strong cost\\ncontainment, a benefits package that covers preventive and primary care; and\\nmeasures that protect quality and people\\'s ability to choose their doctors.  \\n<p>\\n   The statements last night reflect the Democrats\\' hope for a fresh start to\\nthe health debate, which has become bogged down in controversy and political\\nsniping. The strategy is to portray the bills that go to the House and Senate\\nfloor as more moderate, reflecting the many concerns voiced since the beginning\\nof the health debate. \"We\\'ve listened to America, all of us,\" said Sen.\\nMitchell. \"We told the president we\\'re going to propose different approaches to\\nachieve the same goals.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Nevertheless, neither the House nor the Senate leadership has yet rounded up\\nsufficient votes to pass a health bill. And despite the leaders\\' emphasis on a\\nnew approach, the bills they are designing aren\\'t radically different from the\\nadministration\\'s proposal.  \\n<p>\\n   For example, the bill the leaders take to the House floor will include some\\nform of Mr. Clinton\\'s controversial requirement that all employers pay part of\\ntheir workers\\' health-insurance premiums. \"We plan to have employer mandates,\"\\nsaid Mr. Foley. Overall, the bill is expected to resemble legislation passed\\nthis summer by the House Ways and Means Committee, which also would set up a\\npublic program for the poor, the unemployed and some employees of small\\nbusiness.  \\n<p>\\n   In the Senate, Sen. Mitchell is weighing several options designed to\\neventually achieve universal coverage. A leading choice would be to give market\\nreforms a chance to work for several years. Then, if near-universal coverage\\nisn\\'t achieved, a series of standby measures would take effect, requiring\\nemployers to contribute to their workers\\' health-insurance costs. The level of\\nthe contribution would vary according to the size of the business, under one\\nidea being considered, with the smallest companies paying the least.  \\n<p>\\n   Another idea, being pushed by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), would\\ngradually phase in a so-called employer mandate, starting first with the\\nrequirement that employers pay half of their workers\\' health-insurance premiums\\ninstead of the 80% requirement in the Clinton proposal. Employers also would\\nhave to fund coverage for workers only, not the employees\\' dependents. Under\\nthis plan, all children would be covered from the start through government\\nprograms.  \\n<p>\\n   The House leaders are worried that if Sen. Mitchell\\'s proposal is more\\nconservative than theirs, a more ambitious House bill could have trouble\\ngetting enough support to pass. The leading scenario for timing makes this a\\nstrong possibility. Under that plan, the Senate would begin debating health\\ncare first, probably late next week or early in August, thus exposing to public\\nview the Senate plan.  \\n<p>\\n   The House would vote on its health-care plan during the second week of\\nAugust. As a result, House aides say it would be difficult for the House to\\nproceed on a bill that is much different than the Senate\\'s.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0086 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0215 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2329 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220083 </ACCESN>\\n<GV> G/CIA G/EXE G/IGV G/STD </GV>\\n<SB> N/EDC N/PLT </SB>\\n<RE> R/AG R/IR R/ISR R/JD R/LTM R/ML R/NME R/SM R/SY R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Diplomacy That Can Stop Terror  ----  By Steven Emerson </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   The meeting next week between Jordan\\'s King Hussein and Israeli Prime\\nMinister Yitzhak Rabin at the White House will undoubtedly be heralded by the\\nClinton administration as the solution to the terrorist violence waged by the\\n\"opponents of peace.\" In fact, the notion that Mideast-inspired terrorism can\\nonly be fought by \"peace\" is emerging as a strategic philosophy of the\\nadministration. In response to the terrorist bombing of the Jewish community\\ncenter in Buenos Aires on Monday, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said\\nthat he would \"redouble {U.S.} efforts\" to achieve peace in the Mideast.  \\n<p>\\n   If the \"peace\" offensive remains the only U.S. policy against terrorism,\\nthen this week\\'s bombing in Argentina -- which killed 39 people (according to\\nthe latest count) -- is all but guaranteed to be repeated around the world in\\ncoming years. Those carrying out such terrorist acts will not be suddenly\\npersuaded to stop their violence because of peace efforts between Israel and\\nits Arab neighbors. In fact, the very opposite is true: The more prominent such\\npeace efforts appear, the more infuriated these groups become.  \\n<p>\\n   The undeniable fact is that the agenda of such terrorist groups cannot be\\nreconciled with Western notions of what constitute \"legitimate grievances.\"\\nTheir hatred of Jews, Christians, secularists, democrats and the West in\\ngeneral is unrelenting. To these radical groups, \"peace\" is nothing more than a\\ncontinuation of the Zionist-infidel conspiracy waged against Islam since the\\nCrusades. Nothing will satisfy them until the infidels have been defeated.  \\n<p>\\n   U.S. policy makers need to recognize the depth of the problem, instead of\\nwallowing in the self-denial of \"peace initiatives.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Although investigators are still sifting through the wreckage in Buenos\\nAires, analysts for the State Department and the CIA have tentatively concluded\\nthat Iran, Hezbollah and local Argentinian Islamic fundamentalists are the\\nculprits. Besides coming right after Israel struck at Hezbollah targets in\\nLebanon, this week\\'s bombing is virtually identical to the one in March 1992\\nthat destroyed the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, killing 29 people.  \\n<p>\\n   Electronic intelligence, coupled with an extensive forensic investigation,\\nfound that Iran had helped acquire the plastic explosives that were used in\\nthat bombing. These were assembled into a massive suicide car bomb by local\\nradical Lebanese Shiites, who in recent years have developed an extensive\\ninfrastructure in the \"tri-border\" area where the Argentinian, Brazilian and\\nParaguayan borders meet. Hezbollah\\'s Islamic Jihad -- traditionally backed and\\nsponsored by Iran -- claimed credit and released a surveillance videotape of\\nthe Israeli Embassy before the bombing.  \\n<p>\\n   This week\\'s reprise -- accompanied by a call claiming credit from a group\\ncalling itself Islamic Command -- carried the same forensic trademarks. This\\ntime, however, Iran and Hezbollah denied any responsibility, a claim that some\\nnews organizations seemed to take at face value. In CNN\\'s reporting on the day\\nof the bombing, the network not only omitted Islamic Command\\'s claim of\\nresponsibility -- and the likelihood that Iran was involved -- but falsely\\nstated that no one ever took credit for the 1992 bombing.  \\n<p>\\n   Indeed, the state sponsorship of terrorism is often ignored or obscured. But\\nit doesn\\'t take a rocket scientist to realize that Iran\\'s threat to the world\\ncomes as much from its low-cost, easily exported terrorist warfare as from its\\nballistic missiles. Such influence can be exerted directly, as in the arms and\\nmoney it funnels to Hezbollah in Lebanon and to hit squads around the world; or\\nit can be exerted indirectly, in the ideological and religious sustenance it\\nprovides to those who issue death threats against declared enemies of Islam,\\nlike Salman Rushdie or Taslima Nasrin, the Bangladeshi writer who has recently\\nbeen threatened with death for making remarks deemed critical of the Koran.  \\n<p>\\n   Of course, Iran is not the only power aiding and abetting the activities of\\nradical terrorists. U.S. intelligence shows indisputably that Syria, which\\nMessrs. Clinton and Christopher have been wooing for the past half year, has\\nprovided sanctuary to Hezbollah fighters, and has allowed the free passage of\\nweapons (even through Damascus) from Iran to Lebanon. What is more, Mr. Assad\\nregularly provides sanctuary -- in the heart of Damascus -- to radical Islamic\\nfundamentalists who have targeted and killed U.S. citizens, such as Hamas and\\nfactions of Islamic Jihad.  \\n<p>\\n   Even more worrisome, Hamas and other radical Islamic fundamentalists have\\nestablished their own infrastructures throughout the West, particularly in the\\nU.S. Exploiting the freedoms, loopholes and naivete that can be found in the\\nAmerican system, these radicals have discovered that the U.S. is a perfect\\nplace for amassing money and arms to carry out their battles with the infidels.\\nDocuments uncovered in connection with the World Trade Center bombing last year\\nshow a vast network of radical supporters running from Los Angeles to Boston.  \\n<p>\\n   The bombing of the Jewish center in Buenos Aires will probably end up taking\\nmore lives than any terrorist bombing since Pan Am 103. In his presidential\\ncampaign, Mr. Clinton told the families of Pan Am 103 victims that it was time\\nfor the U.S. to stop coddling dictators and to crack down on the world-wide\\nscourge of terrorism.

Hwang  Staff Reporter \\n    of The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   NEW YORK -- Colgate-Palmolive Co. reported flat second-quarter earnings that\\nreflected continuing problems in the U.S. market and a one-time charge related\\nto the planned sale of a small unit.  \\n<p>\\n   The news sent Colgate\\'s stock, which has been declining for months, down\\nfurther. Colgate closed at $50.50, down $1.75, in heavy New York Stock Exchange\\ncomposite trading. The shares traded as high as $65.375 in March.  \\n<p>\\n   The consumer-products concern posted second-quarter net income of $142.5\\nmillion, or 87 cents a share, compared with $142.4 million, or 81 cents a\\nshare, a year earlier. The increase in per-share net reflects Colgate\\'s recent\\nbuyback program, which resulted in 8% fewer average shares outstanding.\\nExcluding the effect of the $5 million charge related to Princess House, which\\nsells crystal tableware and other decorative items, Colgate\\'s earnings rose 4%\\nto $148 million, and its per-share net climbed 13% to 97 cents. Sales rose 7%\\nto $1.9 billion.  \\n<p>\\n   While Colgate\\'s per-share earnings met the company\\'s oft-stated goal of\\nannual increases of 13% to 18%, the operating profit growth and a drop in gross\\nprofit margins took Wall Street by surprise. It was unusual that the company\\nfailed to meet analysts\\' consensus estimates of second-quarter per-share net of\\n99 cents. In the past, Colgate Chief Executive Officer Reuben Mark has been a\\nWall Street favorite for reliably meeting or beating such projections.  \\n<p>\\n   \"Many feel that if Reuben can\\'t manage earnings up to normal, it must have\\nbeen really hard to even get the number they reported,\" said Alice Beebe\\nLongley, analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. Still, Ms.\\nLongley said, the worst may be over.  \\n<p>\\n   Other analysts remain downbeat about Colgate\\'s outlook. \"They said they\\'re\\ngoing to strengthen in the second half of the year without any real indication\\nwhy,\" said Lynne Hyman, First Boston Corp.\\'s analyst, who is planning to lower\\nher full-year earnings estimate of $3.90 a share. \"Frankly, they\\'ve been saying\\nthat for the last several quarters.\"  \\n<p>\\n   There\\'s little question that Colgate\\'s biggest problems are in the U.S.\\nmarket, where its toothpastes and other products have been hurt by tough\\ncompetition and retail inventory cutbacks. In the U.S., Colgate\\'s\\nsecond-quarter sales sank 13%. While Colgate noted that its market shares have\\nimproved in each of the past two quarters, analysts said they remain below\\nyear-earlier levels.  \\n<p>\\n   In the second quarter, \"weakness in the U.S. had a much bigger than expected\\nimpact on the overall gross profits of the company,\" said Bonita Austin, an\\nanalyst at Prudential Securities Inc.  \\n<p>\\n   The weakness in the U.S. was partly offset by Colgate\\'s performance in\\nEurope, where sales jumped 11% on the strength of acquisitions and the growth\\nof existing businesses in France, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom.\\nColgate attributed the improvements to increased advertising and such new\\nproducts as Colgate Total plaque-fighting toothpaste and its Precision\\ntoothbrush. Sales in Latin America increased 11%, while sales in the Asia and\\nAfrica region grew 26%.  \\n<p>\\n   Sales in Colgate\\'s Hill\\'s Pet Nutrition unit grew 19%, benefiting from\\nhigher marketing expenditures.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0091 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0216 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2222 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220088 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> G.LHA GM GME TNET </CO>\\n<IN> I/AIR I/AUT I/CPR I/DRG I/SOF </IN>\\n<SB> N/CTC N/HIY N/JVN N/LAB N/LIC N/MRK N/PDS N/TNM </SB>\\n<MS> M/CYC M/NCY M/TEC </MS>\\n<RE> R/CA R/EU R/GE R/MI R/MN R/NME R/PRM R/TX R/US R/WEU </RE>\\n<HL> GM\\'s EDS, Lufthansa Plan  Data-Technology Venture </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   DALLAS -- Electronic Data Systems Corp. plans to form a joint venture with\\nGerman airline Lufthansa AG to market information-technology services to the\\ntravel industry.  \\n<p>\\n   EDS, a unit of General Motors Corp., said it plans to take a 25% stake in\\nLufthansa\\'s information-technology division, which would be a separate company\\ncalled Systemhaus GmbH.

Open any\\ntextbook on American art and there it is: his painting of the bridge from 1920,\\na spiky, splintered nocturnal view in which soaring steel cables and a blur of\\ntraffic lights are visible through a dark crush of forms. An American futurist,\\nStella is credited with bridging the space between European avant-garde art and\\nAmerican subject matter, though few can say what he did in the course of his\\nlong life other than paint the bridge.  \\n<p>\\n   Now we know. The Stella retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art,\\nthe first major survey in more than 30 years, presents him as a prolific artist\\nwhose career was more variegated than anyone realizes. I\\'m not sure Stella is\\nenlarged by the exhibition, but still it\\'s an interesting affair, a\\nquintessential New York story. Organized by Barbara Haskell, the show has the\\nvirtue of coaxing a vanished era back to life -- the era, that is, of the New\\nYork avant-garde in the years between the two world wars.  \\n<p>\\n   Born near Naples in 1877, Stella came here at the age of 19. Living in\\nGreenwich Village, he became friendly with Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray and the\\nother artists who used to gather at the apartment of the collector Walter\\nArensberg. A photograph of Stella from 1920 shows him slumped against a wall\\nbeside Duchamp, his massive head contrasting with the Frenchman\\'s lean, ascetic\\nface. Both men were uprooted Europeans, and yet they\\'re an unlikely pair.\\nCompared to the larksome Duchamp, Stella was too ardent a believer in the\\nphysical beauty of both nature and the city to have any interest in irony.  \\n<p>\\n   Stella\\'s bridge pictures (there are six major variations in all) form the\\nheart of the Whitney show; and they\\'re almost religious in their intensity. A\\nbridge is obviously a horizontal structure that runs parallel to the earth\\'s\\nsurface, but Stella\\'s bridges are painted on vertical canvases and have an\\nupward momentum; you see the bridge the way a person would upon entering into\\nit. Stella wants to show what it\\'s like to glance up through the tall girders\\nand feel amazed, and he depicts the bridge as a virtual cathedral arching to\\nimpossible heights.  \\n<p>\\n   While it\\'s tempting to say that only an immigrant could have viewed the\\nBrooklyn Bridge as romantic ideal, the poet Hart Crane -- from Cleveland, Ohio\\n-- shared Stella\\'s enchantment and is believed to have been influenced by his\\npaintings. Crane\\'s great poem \"The Bridge\" (1930) similarly infuses a modern\\nscene of \"traffic lights\" and \"acetylene\" with an \"immaculate sigh of stars\"\\nthat suggests an almost medieval spirituality.  \\n<p>\\n   For Stella, the bridge was perhaps a psychological symbol as well, a\\nstructure that could span the great divides of his own nature. Clearly he was\\nan uncomfortable man. He may hold the record for having lived in more\\napartments than any other artist of his time. If futurism is the style that\\nglorified motion, Stella himself was a futurist creation who couldn\\'t stop\\nmoving. Besides recording his frequent extended stays in Europe, the chronology\\nin the catalog follow him to 12 different apartments in New York as he traipsed\\nfrom Greenwich Village to the outer reaches of Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens.\\nHis reluctance to settle in any one place was echoed in his romantic liaisons,\\nwhich were similarly marked by a suspicion of attachments. \"Love of any sort,\"\\nhe once declared, \"ends in slavery.\"  \\n<p>\\n   All of this is relevant because Stella treated artistic schools much as he\\ndid apartments, forever leasing a new one. He worked in so many different\\nstyles that the Whitney retrospective (which remains up through Oct. 9) can\\nseem like a group show featuring a dozen artists. Each room is devoted to a new\\nphase of his career: old master drawings in the first room; futurist\\nexperiments in the second; illustrations of Bethlehem Steel workers in the\\nthird. He made botanically correct studies of lillies and blue hydrangeas. He\\nmade collages, too, gluing newspaper cut-outs and cigarette labels into spare,\\npoetic arrangements that look back to Kurt Schwitters and forward to Joseph\\nCornell. Nearly all these works have the same competent but derivative feeling.\\n \\n<p>\\n   His art eventually took a bizarre turn. After trying all the latest styles,\\nhe dropped out from the avant-garde and retreated into a style of figuration\\ninspired by the religious icons of his Italian past. The kitchy \"Virgin\"\\n(1926), in which a pale-faced madonna is draped in an overlay of fruits and\\nflowers, is painted in candied pinks and blues reminiscent of popular\\ndevotional images. Yet even here, on the outermost fringes of mainstream\\ntradition, Stella can still seem derivative. The quasireligious compositions of\\nhis last two decades are, I think, heavily indebted to Georgia O\\'Keeffe, who\\nsimilarly turned mysticism into the flat, decorative forms of poster art.  \\n<p>\\n   Leaving the Whitney show, I didn\\'t think much more of Stella\\'s work than I\\ndid upon entering it. Yet while he hasn\\'t gained in stature, he does gain our\\nsympathy; we come to see him as a zealous character, a painter-pilgrim\\nwandering two continents in search of something to believe in. Stella died in\\n1946, the exact moment when the abstract expressionists were about to astound\\nthe world with their own faith -- in the painterly gesture -- and finally give\\nthe American art scene a form equal to its fervor.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0093 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0216 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2209 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220090 </ACCESN>\\n<PAGE> C1          </PAGE>\\n<CO> CALL ONEC </CO>\\n<IN> I/CTS I/TLS </IN>\\n<SB> N/ANL N/BON N/COB N/HIY N/TNM </SB>\\n<MS> M/UTI </MS>\\n<RE> R/CO R/NJ R/NME R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Nextel Acquisition Upsets Bondholders  ----  By Greg Steinmetz  \\n    Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   When is a corporate takeover not a takeover?  \\n<p>\\n   When it\\'s cheaper to call it a merger.  \\n<p>\\n   That\\'s the approach Nextel Communications Inc. is taking in its pending $650\\nmillion acquisition of OneComm Corp. The reason: The wireless communications\\ncompany can save on borrowing costs by assuming OneComm\\'s debt instead of\\nhaving to buy back OneComm\\'s bonds through a tender offer.  \\n<p>\\n   OneComm\\'s bond prospectus, like many others, calls for a buyback if there is\\na change of control. Those buybacks usually result in the acquiring company\\npaying bondholders 101% of face value. In the case of the OneComm bonds --\\nwhich are zero-coupon bonds that do not pay interest periodically but in a lump\\nsum at maturity -- they would be bought back at 101% of the \"accreted value,\"\\nwhich is the value based on how much interest has accumulated.  \\n<p>\\n   But during a conference call on the Nextel takeover two weeks ago, an\\ninvestor asked Nextel officials whether they planned to buy back the bonds.\\nNextel\\'s answer was a decisive \"no.\"  \\n<p>\\n   That answer has at least one OneComm bondholder plenty angry. \"They are\\nclearly breaking the spirit of the agreement,\" argues David Gilson, an analyst\\nwith IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis. He worries that the maneuver sets a\\nscary precedent for bondholders. While he\\'s upset about his OneComm holdings,\\nhe\\'s more worried about other bonds of potential takeover candidates he\\'s\\nholding. \"I\\'m more concerned about what\\'s remaining in the portfolio,\" he said.\\n \\n<p>\\n   A Nextel spokesman says some other bondholders have complained, but \"once\\nthey understand the transaction, they understand the treatment.\"  \\n<p>\\n   The issue reminds veteran bond hands of the 1988 dispute between RJR Nabisco\\nand its bondholders. RJR enjoyed sterling creditworthiness before Kohlberg\\nKravis Roberts & Co. bought the company and loaded it with debt. The change\\ncrushed bondholders and sparked lawsuits.  \\n<p>\\n   Indeed, it was the fear of repeating the RJR debacle that prompted bond\\nlawyers to include takeover provisions in bond indentures, the documents that\\ndefine a bond\\'s terms. The OneComm issue tests the strength of those provisions\\nand may prompt bond lawyers to stiffen the terms of future bond issues.  \\n<p>\\n   \"This shows the necessity of tightening up the convenants as much as\\npossible,\" said Kingman Penniman, head of highyield research at Duff & Phelps\\nin Montpelier, Vt.  \\n<p>\\n   OneComm issued the bonds, which were underwritten by Merrill Lynch & Co., in\\nJanuary. The zero-coupon bonds accumulate interest at a 10.125% interest rate\\nfor five years and then pay a coupon for the next five years.  \\n<p>\\n   Prices on the bonds began falling in the spring after interest rates rose\\nand the spread between Treasurys and junk-bond prices widened. Because Nextel\\nis more creditworthy than OneComm, prices recovered earlier this month after\\nNextel made its offer for Denver-based OneComm. But Mr. Gilson argues the\\nprices would rise even higher if Nextel bought the bonds back. He says the\\nbonds, which now trade for about 57 cents on the dollar, would rise to 65 in a\\ntender offer.  \\n<p>\\n   The OneComm acquisition calls for Nextel to buy OneComm, and then dissolve\\nOneComm by merging it into Nextel\\'s own operations. Nextel plans to finance the\\ntransaction by issuing 22.4 million of its shares to OneComm stockholders.\\nNextel currently has about 100 million shares outstanding.  \\n<p>\\n   Although the OneComm bond indenture calls for the bonds to be bought out in\\na \"change of control,\" the document\\'s definition of what constitutes a \"change\\nof control\" provides a way out, according to Nextel\\'s reading of the document.\\nAccording to the document, a change of control occurs if an individual or\\ncorporation buys more than 50% of the voting stock of the target.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Markell says the provision would kick in if OneComm became a wholly\\nowned unit of Nextel. But because OneComm is being merged into Nextel, it will\\nnot be owned by Nextel but by Nextel stockholders, none of whom own more than\\n50% of Nextel\\'s common stock.  \\n<p>\\n   \"The language is quite clear,\" Mr. Markell says. \"The bond documents do not\\nsay we have to buy back the bonds, so why should we?\"  \\n<p>\\n   Nextel\\'s position makes good business sense given the recent rise in\\ninterest rates. If it borrowed the $270 million to buy back the bonds, it would\\nhave to borrow at a 12% rate compared with the 10.125% rate the bonds now pay. \\n\\n<p>\\n   Mr. Markell says the company has better things to do with its money than buy\\nback bonds. Nextel, of Rutherford, N.J., is currently embarked on a massive\\ncapital spending program designed to make it a major player in wireless\\ncommunications. \"We think our shareholders -- and our bondholders -- would like\\nto see us put our resources into carrying out our business plans,\" he says.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0094 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0217 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2211 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220091 </ACCESN>\\n<SB> N/RVW </SB>\\n<HL> LEISURE & ARTS -- Bookshelf:  Self-Reliance: How Cultures Succeed \\n    or Fail  ----  By Joel Kotkin </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   In social science, as in so many things, we clearly inhabit what the great\\nHarvard sociologist Pitrim Sorokin once described as an \"era of midget\\nphilosophers.\" Between the forces of political correctness and mathematical\\nobscurantism, social science, once the domain of giants such as Max Weber and\\nGeorg Simmel, has devolved toward an ever more strident irrelevancy.  \\n<p>\\n   Amidst this bleak background, sociologist Thomas Sowell, a senior fellow at\\nthe Hoover Institute at Stanford University, has provided one of the few bright\\nspots. For the better part of the last decade, Mr. Sowell\\'s books on race,\\neconomics and markets have constituted a rare repository of insights on some of\\nthe most pressing social-science concerns of our times.  \\n<p>\\n   In his most recent book, \"Race and Culture: A World View\" (Basic Books, 331\\npages, $25), Mr. Sowell revisits many of the themes that have characterized his\\npast works. Once again he takes on the current academic craze to ascribe all\\nsocial dysfunction to the so-called victimization of groups by social and\\neconomic institutions. Instead, he focuses on such often underappreciated\\nfactors as attitudes to explain differences between various ethnic groups. He\\nis, in a very real sense, a modern successor to the kind of acute,\\nculture-based social science epitomized by Max Weber.  \\n<p>\\n   Like Weber, Mr. Sowell identifies the primary source of group success not so\\nmuch \"external\" forces such as imperialism and racism, but \"internal\"\\ninfluences such as adaptability to change. Habits of mind help elucidate why\\nmodern Europeans, particularly the British, made the first bold steps into the\\nindustrial era. Similarly, prevailing attitudes about such basic values as\\nthrift and family responsibility do much to explain the contemporary rise of\\nEast Asian societies and economies.  \\n<p>\\n   Even more politically incorrect, Mr. Sowell dares to argue that some\\ncultures are \"superior\" and \"more advanced\" than others, in the broad tableaux\\nof history. He points out that many of the indigenous societies overcome by the\\nWest, such as the Aztecs, were hardly models of enlightenment.  \\n<p>\\n   But Mr. Sowell is no simple apologist for things Western. He points instead\\nto the dynamic nature of ethnic group development. Before its long period of\\nascendancy, for example, the European West was culturally inferior both to the\\nnearby Islamic and distant Chinese civilizations.  \\n<p>\\n   Perhaps nowhere is Mr. Sowell\\'s acuity more welcome than in his discussion\\nof the issue of slavery. Unlike many historians, particularly of the\\nAfrocentric variety, Mr. Sowell places slavery in its long-term historic\\ncontext. In contrast to current fashion, he argues that its form here in North\\nAmerica was not, in its critical aspects, markedly worse than that practiced\\nelsewhere.  \\n<p>\\n   Yet for all his insights, Mr. Sowell\\'s approach is often too lacking in\\nspecificity to hit home or open new territory. Throughout the text there seems\\nto be an overreliance on dated and secondary source materials. Perhaps it is\\nthis dearth of fresh research that sometimes leads him to repeat virtually the\\nsame anecdote or factoid. In one case, he recites an insight about Circassian\\nfemales sold into slavery under the Ottomans twice within 16 pages.  \\n<p>\\n   Equally important, Mr. Sowell might have used some firsthand interviews to\\nenliven his text. In his introduction, Mr. Sowell reveals the emotional impact\\nof seeing the great mosque at Cordoba and coming upon a collection of German\\ngravestones in Australia\\'s Barossa Valley. Curiously, he tells us little about\\nthe people -- except for the academics -- who live there today.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Sowell\\'s unwillingness to provide specificity -- such as naming names --\\nin his assault on Afrocentric and other popular ideological causes weakens his\\ncase. At a time when academics of good faith, a no doubt dwindling breed,\\nrequire a full arsenal to combat rampant intellectual dishonesty, Mr. Sowell\\'s\\npolite and usually indirect approach seems like arming Bosnia with lofty\\nresolutions rather than military equipment.  \\n<p>\\n   A more ready use of contemporary data would also have bolstered Mr. Sowell\\'s\\ndiscussion on critical issues such as the detrimental cultural impact of\\nrace-based quotas or welfarism among African-Americans. Particularly, one\\nhungers for a deep cultural explanation why African-Americans, after boasting\\nhigher rates of labor participation than whites from 1890 to 1950, now\\ncomparatively seem so estranged from the culture of work and enterprise.  \\n<p>\\n   All this suggests that Mr. Sowell and his editors have become a bit too\\ncomfortable with themselves. Perhaps it is time for him to move unto new ground\\nand fresher researches. New explorations could well establish Mr. Sowell as a\\nwriter whose work will speak, as does that of Weber, to the ages.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Kotkin is a Los Angeles-based senior fellow at the Center for the New\\nWest and author of \"Tribes: How Race, Religion and Identity Determine Success\\nin the New Global Economy\" (Random House).  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0095 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0217 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2211 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220092 </ACCESN>\\n<SB> N/SPT </SB>\\n<RE> R/CO R/NME R/US </RE>\\n<HL> LEISURE & ARTS -- On Sports:  A Long Day\\'s Journey Into Deep Heat \\n     ----  By Caitlin Kelly </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   Grand Canyon National Park -- You can\\'t say they don\\'t warn you. In a window\\ndisplay at the grocery store inside Grand Canyon National Park is a large color\\nphoto of chilling directness: a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a steel\\nrazor gleaming in the sun, the only remains of a lost hiker. There is also a\\nnewspaper handed to every park visitor at the gate warning that hiking the\\nGrand Canyon is largely a matter of water and mental attitude. Detailed signs\\nat every trail head show a man collapsing from heat exhaustion, and there\\'s\\nwarnings in four languages 100 feet into each trail.  \\n<p>\\n   So it was with excitement, some trepidation and a backpack full of water\\n(seven pounds), food and a camera with two lenses (about another four pounds),\\nthat I recently set off down the canyon\\'s Bright Angel Trail. From 1903 to 1924\\nit was controlled by hotelier Ralph Cameron, who charged a toll to travelers.\\nToday, there\\'s nothing special at its entrance. The long, thin, dusty white\\ntrail starts at the south rim, descends through 3,220 feet of elevation and, if\\nyou go to its furthest point, Plateau Point, 12.2 miles round-trip, the hike\\nusually takes eight to 12 hours.  \\n<p>\\n   Below the rim it\\'s a different world. Instantly the tour buses and screaming\\nkids and sullen teenagers and T-shirt shops and phone booths are gone. So are\\nease, safety and comfort. The only way to get them back is on your own two\\nfeet.  \\n<p>\\n   Bright Angel Trail has four stops along the way that most hikers aim for.\\nThe closest is a rest house 1.5 miles into the canyon. I was heading for\\nPlateau Point, a hike park rangers describe as \"very strenuous.\" I\\'m a fit and\\nathletic 37, and wasn\\'t worried. I had food, water, a cap.  \\n<p>\\n   The trail itself is narrow, steep, studded with rocks and roots. There are\\nno guardrails, no ropes, nothing to grab for or hang on to should you slip or\\nlose your concentration. And it\\'s a long way down, as seven people discovered\\nin 1993 when they fell to their deaths.  \\n<p>\\n   According to park statistics, in a recent three-year period, 750 hikers on\\nthe Bright Angel and Kaibab trails were able to return to the rim only after\\nseeking help from park rangers. The only toilet is at least two hours below\\nyou. The nearest emergency phone is 1.5 miles away, near the nearest metal\\nlitter to carry you out. There are two helicopter landing sites on the trail,\\nsays Nick Herring, a senior ranger at the park, but anyone who needs one will\\nhave to pay the $1,100 cost. If you\\'re simply pooped, you can\\'t just whip out\\nyour gold card and say \"Come get me,\" he warns. They won\\'t.  \\n<p>\\n   The Inner Canyon, as it\\'s called, is predictably stunning. Like the arctic,\\nits colors change almost every minute with shifts in sun and shade and haze.\\nWhat comes as a wonderful surprise is the sense of isolation that is still,\\nsomehow, possible on a trail used by 1,500 hikers a day. The first section\\ndescends through pale 250-million-year-old Kaibab limestone, studded with\\nfossils and ancient shells. It\\'s relatively cool 7,000 feet up, 88 degrees at\\n9:30 the morning I began. A breeze blew through the gambel oak, pinyon pine and\\njuniper bushes. Ravens floated past. A fox leaped across the trail in a single\\nbound six feet ahead of me. Cool and still, the canyon felt as though it were\\nmine alone.  \\n<p>\\n   Suddenly, a mule train clopped by. Then, a clump of hikers: a man in his 60s\\nwith a young woman hiking in sneakers without socks, a morbidly obese woman\\nturning a scary red, a whippet-lean man running bare-chested, a five-year-old\\nboy being dragged upward by his father. A trio of teenagers had left the trail\\nentirely to scale a loose mass of rock.  \\n<p>\\n   I hit Indian Garden, 9.2 miles down, in two hours. I\\'d barely broken a\\nsweat. But there, the temperature was 105. The breeze was gone. I soaked my\\nhead, refilled my water bottles from a fountain near the creek and headed for\\nPlateau Point, 1.5 miles away across flat ground. Flat desert, actually, at\\nnoon; no shade, nowhere to sit, no water. I\\'d already removed my ring as my\\nhands began to swell. I felt as if I were broiling, and started to waste water,\\nsquirting it on my neck and legs. The hiking here was easy, but the heat\\noverwhelming.  \\n<p>\\n   Plateau Point, a pile of flat rocks with a guardrail and spectacular views,\\nis the furthest distance park rangers recommend any hiker attempt in one day,\\nbecause it takes twice as long to come out as it does to descend. From there,\\nfar below, I could see and hear the bright green frigid waters of the Colorado\\nRiver. A pair of huge blue rubber rafts bobbed by. I could see hikers further\\ndown, coming to or from Phantom Ranch at the Canyon floor, where temperatures\\nwere hitting 112.  \\n<p>\\n   The silence was absolute. No cars, no planes, no voices, no birds or animals\\nor wind. If it\\'s possible to fall in love with a geological formation, that\\'s\\nwhere it happened to me. The red-and-white buttes I\\'d gazed down upon that\\nmorning now towered high above. A spiky agave plant in bloom, its six-foot\\nflower stalk piercing the brilliant sky, was the only sign of life.  \\n<p>\\n   And then I looked back up to where I\\'d started and felt an ugly twinge of\\nfear. I\\'d never get out. Nick Herring says he gets 15 emergency calls every day\\nfrom the trail, a third of them people so panicked they say they can\\'t make it\\nback. I could understand it. I was alone and hot and tired and hungry and, even\\nhaving drunk water every five minutes, thirsty. I sat in the creek at Indian\\nGardens in the shade and ate my lunch.  \\n<p>\\n   I started back at 2:30. The woman with no socks said her feet were totally\\nblistered. Her companion said they\\'d already hiked down to the river, a trip\\nthat recently almost killed a 33-year-old German woman whose temperature\\nreached 104 by the time an emergency crew flew her out. As Herring says,\\n\"There\\'s nothing in the world like hiking the canyon. First you cross a desert,\\nthen you climb a mountain.\"  \\n<p>\\n   The trip back up became a sort of tag-team desperation match as a group of\\nabout 25 of us passed each other, meeting up, panting and red, at the rest\\nhouses to sit for a few moments and rehydrate. It didn\\'t matter how old or\\nyoung you were, you just had to stop and rest, sometimes every five minutes.\\nEven at 4:30, the heat was still intense. Only in the final third of the ascent\\ndid the temperature drop enough to feel bearable. And by then we were all wrung\\nout.  \\n<p>\\n   I came out at 6:30. My T-shirt was stiff with sweat, the straps of my pack\\nwhite with salt. My socks were unsalvageable, my sneakers red with dirt. I\\nstaggered to the nearest building for my reward.  \\n<p>\\n   Chocolate fudge ice cream never tasted so good.  \\n<p>\\n   Ms. Kelly is a free-lance writer and nationally ranked saber fencer in\\nTarrytown, N.Y.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0096 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0217 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2204 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220093 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> FHPC </CO>\\n<IN> I/HEA </IN>\\n<GV> G/STE </GV>\\n<SB> N/HIY N/LAW N/LWS </SB>\\n<MS> M/NCY </MS>\\n<RE> R/CA R/ID R/NME R/PRM R/US </RE>\\n<HL> The Business of Law:  HMO Faces Damages </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   A state-court jury in Boise, Idaho, has awarded more than $26 million in\\ndamages against a health-maintenance organization for denying coverage for a\\nman\\'s liver transplant.  \\n<p>\\n   The man\\'s wife sued her HMO, Lincoln National Health Plan, after it said the\\ntransplant wasn\\'t covered under her contract with the plan.

Some of them are joining other companies to offer quality day\\ncare to low-paid workers. Others are financing improvements in community-run\\nday care or taking child-care help directly to the factory floor.  \\n<p>\\n   In the past few years, federal grants and tax credits have helped fuel\\ngrowth in child care. But the quality of the care varies widely, and\\nlower-middle-class and working-poor parents are deeply vulnerable to bad care.\\nThey make too much to qualify for much government help, and corporate\\nchild-care assistance has typically benefited higher-income employees.  \\n<p>\\n   With 136,000 hourly employees in service jobs, Marriott International Inc.,\\nBethesda, Md., depends heavily on low-paid workers. Yet child-care and other\\nfamily and personal problems fuel entry-level turnover of as much as 300% a\\nyear at some of its hotels, as well as high absenteeism on the job.  \\n<p>\\n   Recently, two Marriott hotels in Atlanta signed on another employer with\\nsimilar problems -- a competing Omni hotel -- to build a subsidized\\nround-the-clock child-care and family-services center, set to open by early\\n1995, with 80% of its 250 slots reserved for low-income families. Hyatt and\\nHilton hotels are considering joining the venture, Marriott says, and it hopes\\nto replicate the partnership in other cities.  \\n<p>\\n   As a kind of 1990s-style \"company town,\" the center will offer\\nfamily-support services from public and private agencies, immunizations,\\nparenting workshops and links with social workers. \"We may be defining a new\\nrole for the corporation,\" says J.W. Marriott Jr., chairman and president of\\nMarriott.  \\n<p>\\n   For Ethel Turner, a housekeeper at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Atlanta and\\na single mother, the center will mean fewer missed days at work. The center\\'s\\nsick-child program will be particularly helpful -- she was out three days last\\nmonth because her four-month-old was ill. She looks forward to spending lunch\\nhours at the center and expects its trained teachers to give her daughter\\ndevelopmental advantages over the neighbor she relies on for child care now.\\nMarriott will also help Ms. Turner apply for subsidies that will put her costs\\nbelow the $55 a week, or 30% of take-home pay, that she now pays the neighbor. \\n\\n<p>\\n   Other companies are taking child-care assistance programs to the plant\\nfloor. Good child care is scarce in the towns where many of Levi Strauss &\\nCo.\\'s 22,000 hourly workers live. And most of the employees, primarily women\\nwith children, can\\'t afford good care anyway.  \\n<p>\\n   So in a pilot program that has drawn widespread attention from other\\nemployers, Levi is offering three kinds of help at plants in El Paso and San\\nAntonio, Texas, and Fayetteville, Ark. Resource and referral counselors help\\nemployees find and choose care, visiting the plant to talk to those without\\ntelephones. The company also pays up to half the cost for low-income employees.\\nThen it provides grants to improve the quality of child-care programs in the\\ncommunity.  \\n<p>\\n   One program that has received Levi funding, a YWCA child-care center in El\\nPaso, moved its opening time back an hour to 5:30 a.m. to accommodate plant\\nworkers and is building a new playground. Levi money also enabled a federally\\nfunded Head Start program for low-income children to move into the YWCA\\nbuilding, enriching both programs.  \\n<p>\\n   Other companies are subtly pressuring parents to demand better quality.\\nNationsBank Corp. ties its child-care subsidies for lower-income employees to a\\nrequirement that care givers be licensed by the state or -- if no license is\\nrequired -- operating legally. One-third of the enrollees have used the money\\nto upgrade their day-care arrangements, says a study by Work/Family Directions\\nInc., a Boston-based consultant.  \\n<p>\\n   No one expects employers to solve all the nation\\'s child-care problems. But\\ncompany efforts are helping spark the broader initiatives that many child-care\\nresearchers and advocates believe are needed. In the most promising trend,\\nabout 40 state and community-planning groups nationwide are bringing\\nearly-childhood education and child-care professionals together, getting\\nparents more involved and studying ways to finance broad improvements in\\nchild-care quality, says Ellen Galinsky, co-president of the Families and Work\\nInstitute, a New York research group.  \\n<p>\\n   Members of the American Business Collaboration, a 144-employer consortium\\nformed in 1992, have backed child-care improvement efforts at the state and\\nlocal level. Collaboration members are helping to fund a nonprofit program in\\nChapel Hill, N.C., the TEACH Early Childhood Project, that helps finance\\ntuition, books, time off and pay raises for child-care workers who want to get\\ncollege degrees while working full-time.  \\n<p>\\n   There are also incentives for child-care centers to improve. The\\nCollaboration and AT&T Corp. have given grants to more than 500 child-care\\ncenters to help them win accreditation from the National Association for the\\nEducation of Young Children, a Washington, D.C., professional educators\\' group.\\nThe association sets higher child-care standards than many states and forces\\ncenter directors and teachers to focus on improving the classroom interaction\\nbetween teacher and child, an important indicator of quality.  \\n<p>\\n   Employers are also using the power of example to raise community standards.\\nHigh-quality child-care facilities financed by the Collaboration in several\\ncities serve the public as well as member companies\\' employees, and have helped\\nraised parents\\' awareness of quality. In Charlotte, N.C., \"many parents were\\nshocked\" at tuition rates when a Collaboration-sponsored center opened in 1991,\\nsays Cheryl Partida, director of the center, which is operated by Bright\\nHorizons Children\\'s Centers Inc., Cambridge, Mass.  \\n<p>\\n   But Ms. Partida seldom hears that complaint now. Many parents have seen the\\nimpact on their children of top-flight materials and staffing and are rushing\\nto sign up their kids\\' siblings. The center has a long waiting list, and Ms.\\nPartida believes its example helped persuade North Carolina regulators to raise\\nstandards. When even a few centers in a community focus on quality, \"it has a\\ngreat impact,\" she says. \"It has helped make people aware of what quality care\\nis.\"  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0098 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0217 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2247 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220095 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> COTTF T.BCB </CO>\\n<IN> I/BVG I/SFT </IN>\\n<SB> N/BBK </SB>\\n<MS> M/NCY </MS>\\n<RE> R/CN R/NME R/QBC </RE>\\n<HL> Cott Plans to Repurchase Shares </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   TORONTO -- Cott Corp. said it plans to buy back up to 4.2 million of its\\n59.7 million shares outstanding over the next year.  \\n<p>\\n   Cott, a Toronto beverage concern, said it hasn\\'t purchased any of its shares\\nin the past 12 months.

Monus, co-founder and former president of Phar-Mor Inc. The new\\nindictment supersedes a 129-count indictment filed in January 1993.  \\n<p>\\n   The superseding indictment adds a criminal charge: obstructing justice by\\nallegedly shredding documents during a grand-jury probe in late 1992, shortly\\nbefore the original indictment was returned.  \\n<p>\\n   The U.S. Attorney\\'s office said the documents related to the now-defunct\\nWorld Basketball League, which Mr. Monus founded and was struggling to finance.\\nHe is accused of channeling $8.8 million in Phar-Mor funds to prop it up.  \\n<p>\\n   Conviction on the obstructing-justice charge could bring up to five years in\\nprison, a $250,000 fine, or both, prosecutors said.  \\n<p>\\n   The new indictment drops 18 money-laundering charges. Moreover, another 96\\nmoney-laundering charges contained in the original indictment have been changed\\nto charges of interstate transportation of stolen property. A single\\nmoney-laundering charge was changed to wire fraud.  \\n<p>\\n   Gerald Messerman, an attorney for the 47-year-old Mr. Monus, called the\\nsuperseding indictment an \"outrage\" and added that \"there was no missing\\nfinancial record\" relating to the World Basketball League to substantiate the\\nnew obstructing-justice charge.  \\n<p>\\n   A three-week trial on the original indictment ended last month with a\\ndeadlocked jury. Three charges were dropped during that trial. A hearing will\\nbe held next month to set a new trial date.  \\n<p>\\n   Phar-Mor, a deep-discount retail chain based in Youngstown, Ohio, filed for\\nChapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August 1992 after saying it was the target\\nof fraud and embezzlement by former executives.

Bleakley  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   KIRYAS JOEL, N.Y. -- When John Karl rounded the corner of Getzel Berger\\nBoulevard here, he couldn\\'t believe his eyes. Hundreds of men were screaming in\\nYiddish, holding torches and stoning Yosef Hirsch\\'s house. \"It made the hair on\\nmy neck stand on end,\" says Mr. Karl, a volunteer fireman from nearby Monroe,\\nof the 1992 incident.  \\n<p>\\n   This ultra-orthodox Hasidic Jewish community was incensed because Mr.\\nHirsch, a rabbi, had accused the village leadership of abuses of federal\\nprograms. It labeled him a \"muser,\" or informer, and hung a 100-foot banner\\natop the shopping center saying his name \"should be banished from the face of\\nthe earth.\"  \\n<p>\\n   If the name Kiryas Joel sounds familiar, it may be because the town is the\\nfocus of a church-state conflict the Supreme Court is currently reviewing:\\nwhether the community\\'s school for the handicapped should be allowed to\\ncontinue getting federal and state aid as a public-school district.\\nStatistically one of the poorest towns in New York state, the incorporated\\nreligious settlement relies heavily on welfare and other state and federal aid.\\nUnder Investigation But there is another, darker side to this modern-day\\npilgrim community nestled in rolling hills 50 miles from New York City. Not\\nonly are civil liberties apparently flouted, but evidence is accumulating that\\nsome of the aid the village depends on may be the product of fraud.  \\n<p>\\n   A U.S. Attorney\\'s office is investigating whether federal funds granted\\nKiryas Joel to build a medical center were diverted for building religious and\\nother projects. State police are trying to determine whether arson was used to\\ncover up such a diversion. The federal Housing and Urban Development Department\\nalso is investigating the medical-center funding.  \\n<p>\\n   James Kerins, a detective who investigated for the insurer, says, \"Whenever\\nwe looked into federal and state-agency funding requests for construction of\\nthe medical center, we found either fraudulent applications, overinflation of\\nbills or failure to adhere to policies of grants.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Interviews with current and former residents suggest the village may be\\nmisusing other federal programs, such as Head Start. Indeed, HUD is part of an\\ninformal federal task force looking into possible fraud in various federal\\nprograms by as many as seven Hasidic sects in three New York counties,\\naccording to people familiar with the inquiry. Besides HUD, the task force\\nincludes the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Postal Service, the Education\\nDepartment and the Internal Revenue Service. The counties are Orange, which is\\nthe site of Kiryas Joel, plus Rockland and Kings (Brooklyn).  \\n<p>\\n   Kiryas Joel is a place given to intimidation. About 300 people out of a\\ntotal of 12,000 living here have broken away from the sect\\'s iron-fisted\\nleadership, which demands obedience and has warned others not to join the\\n\"infidels.\" Vandals have slashed tires on cars of the breakaway members and\\nstoned their houses by night. By day, hatred has been spewed at them and their\\nchildren. Fear rules.  \\n<p>\\n   \"They\\'ve taken away our freedom. Everyone is afraid to talk,\" says Joseph\\nWaldman, a 42-year-old dissident leader who carries a gun because he says he\\nhas received death threats. He and others contend town leaders use some of the\\nlocal rabbinical academy\\'s 800 students as enforcers to frighten and sometimes\\nbeat up dissidents. They also claim that village elders sometimes wiretap\\nresidents\\' phones and deny people the right to vote in federal elections.  \\n<p>\\n   \"This little community, which was once our sunshine, is now the war zone of\\nthe Hasidic world,\" says a member of the breakaway group, speaking from what he\\ncalls a \"secure\" phone elsewhere.  \\n<p>\\n   When approached in his office at the rabbinical academy he runs, the town\\'s\\nreligious leader, Rabbi Aaron Teitelbaum, denies instigating any violence. He\\nrefers questions about other allegations to Abraham Wieder, Kiryas Joel\\'s\\ndeputy mayor, who denies them, saying the breakaway group is conducting \"a\\nsmear campaign aimed at destroying us.\"  \\n<p>\\n   The deputy mayor -- who is also president of the main synagogue and the\\npublic-school district and is active in running parochial schools -- says Mr.\\nWaldman exaggerates incidents caused by a few youths \"who sometimes get out of\\ncontrol.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Kiryas Joel, a village of winding streets and tightly packed garden\\napartments and two-family homes, is part of the Satmar sect of Hasidim, which\\npreaches strict adherence to Old Testament scripture and has about 100,000\\nmembers world-wide. The town, established in 1977, grew as an extension of the\\ncrowded Satmar community in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. Its name\\nmeans Community of Joel, a reference to the late Grand Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum,\\nthe spiritual founder of the Satmars here and in Satu-Mare (St. Mary), Romania.\\nHe died in 1979.  \\n<p>\\n   The Satmars\\' current head is his nephew, 77-year-old Grand Rabbi Moses\\nTeitelbaum, who in turn is the father of town religious leader Rabbi Aaron\\nTeitelbaum. The grand rabbi declines to be interviewed.  \\n<p>\\n   The Satmars shun outsiders and what they view as the corruption of modern\\nsociety, including television. They essentially follow shtetl-like customs of\\n18th-century Eastern Europe. Married women wear wigs over clean-shaven heads.\\nAll females older than five must dress so they are fully covered. Boys and men\\nhave locks of hair dangling by their ears. Men dress in black garb, white\\nshirts and wide-brimmed black hats.  \\n<p>\\n   Religion and the family are at the heart of Kiryas Joel, where a fire\\nwhistle goes off 15 minutes before the Sabbath begins on Fridays. The town has\\n17 synagogues and numerous yeshivas, or religious schools, as well as ritual\\nbathhouses. At home, only Yiddish is spoken. Some older residents, among them\\nmany Holocaust survivors, know little English.  \\n<p>\\n   Children abound in Kiryas Joel, in carriages or playing on lawns and\\nsidewalks. About 700 of the village\\'s 1,300 families have eight or more\\noffspring. Town leaders say proudly that there are no truancy, drugs, teenage\\nsuicides or out-of-wedlock teen pregnancies. Most youths marry at 17 or 18,\\nwith the help of a matchmaker.  \\n<p>\\n   Graduates may not go on to secular higher education in pursuit of a career.\\nMany men continue their studies of Scripture instead of working full time.\\nBusloads of other men make a three-hour daily round trip to work in New York\\nCity\\'s diamond district.  \\n<p>\\n   But for all the sense of community, the town is racked by dissent. It began\\nin the second half of the 1980s, when Grand Rabbi Moses Teitelbaum, over the\\nobjections of some, installed his own group of town leaders, including his son,\\nAaron, as chief rabbi. More trouble flared after the breakaway group set up a\\nrival Satmar school named B\\'nai Joel, invoking the name of the sect\\'s late\\nfounder.  \\n<p>\\n   Meanwhile, federal and state funding poured in. Politicians from Gov. Mario\\nCuomo, a Democrat, to Rep. Benjamin Gilman, a Republican, have been strong\\nsupporters. Hasidic leaders are known for delivering a bloc vote. \"When you\\ntake the congregation\\'s free car service to vote,\" says a woman resident, \"the\\ndriver gives you a card listing who to vote for.\"  \\n<p>\\n   While Kiryas Joel receives a minimum of state and federal aid for its\\noverall school program because it is almost totally self-funded by the main\\nSatmar congregation, about three-fourths of the large families in the village\\nget welfare checks, food stamps or Medicaid. Their welfare, food stamps and\\nrental assistance may amount to about $2 million a year, based on figures from\\ngovernment agencies and a Kiryas Joel social-services official.  \\n<p>\\n   In addition, the community over the past eight years has received more than\\n$20 million in state and federal grants and at least $5 million in loans. This\\nincludes funding for housing, Head Start, the public-school district and\\nconstruction of sidewalks, wells, the medical center and a shopping center.  \\n<p>\\n   Some Hasidic sects, including the Satmars, \"are savvy at taking advantage of\\nall the social programs available, testing the system to the extreme,\" says\\nSamuel Heilman, a professor of Jewish studies at Queens College on Long Island.\\nLast October, the U.S. said it would no longer give millions in Education\\nDepartment \"Pell grants\" to 21 Satmar and Lubavitch Hasidic schools in New York\\nCity and Monsey, N.Y. One stated reason: The schools had defrauded the\\ngovernment by claiming ineligible students.  \\n<p>\\n   And in Los Angeles, a federal court convicted Satmar Rabbi Abraham Low in\\nApril of conspiracy to launder money. Rabbi Low, who is married to a niece of\\nGrand Rabbi Moses Teitelbaum, will appeal.  \\n<p>\\n   Some ordinary residents of Kiryas Joel also attract suspicion. \"There\\'s an\\nawful lot of fraud when it comes to mailboxes and fictitious names in Kiryas\\nJoel,\" asserts Patrick Burke, postmaster of the town of Monroe, which handles\\nthe village\\'s mail. He tells of Social Security checks addressed to slight\\nvariations on the same name going to the same mailbox, and evidence of similar\\nruses for obtaining passports and drivers\\' licenses.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Burke notified long-distance phone company Sprint Corp. of apparent\\nfraud when it kept sending 75 unpaid bills (for a total of some $100,000) to\\nthe same handful of post-office boxes established by Kiryas Joel residents, Mr.\\nBurke says. A Sprint security official, John Anninos, says, \"The other two\\nlong-distance companies also were victimized.\" Sprint couldn\\'t find enough\\nevidence to bring charges.  \\n<p>\\n   Then there is the medical-center matter. The basic question being looked\\ninto by the U.S. Attorney in White Plains, N.Y., by state police and by HUD is\\nwhether federal money meant for the center went for other projects. The partly\\nbuilt center burned in 1990, a month after a HUD inspector became suspicious\\nabout delays. The village entity set up to administer the program hasn\\'t\\nreturned $100,000 of HUD funds that HUD has demanded back.  \\n<p>\\n   \"It was rotten from the get-go,\" says Zachary Greenhill, a New York lawyer\\nand former prosecutor who fought off Kiryas Joel\\'s $1.2 million fire-insurance\\nclaim on the center, reaching a $65,000 settlement. He and his investigators\\nfound, in a 3 1/2 year probe involving 52 subpoenaed witnesses, that more than\\n$130,000 of work paid out of the medical-center project account in 1989 and\\n1990 actually was work on other projects, including a swimming pool for a\\nreligious school.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Greenhill introduced in federal district court in Manhattan a deposition\\nfrom a contractor saying $93,000 paid from the medical-center account was for\\nwork on a condo project headed by a man named Cheskel Kahan. Mr. Kahan led the\\ncorporation set up to oversee medical-center construction, and is also a\\ntrustee of the United Talmudic Academy, or U.T.A., which runs religious\\nschools.  \\n<p>\\n   One contractor, Joseph Germann of Tri-State Sheet Metal Works in\\nBloomingburg, N.Y., says that an invoice for his company\\'s \"diffusers and air\\ngrills\" made out to the U.T.A. was later changed by someone to indicate the\\nbill was for the medical center. He says he didn\\'t do any work on the center.\\nAnd Corrine Tetz of E. Tetz & Sons in Middletown, N.Y., says she \"had no idea\"\\nthat all the concrete her firm delivered for other projects was supposedly for\\nthe center.  \\n<p>\\n   \"The medical project was bled of all its funds for more important projects\\nin the village,\" wrote a design and engineering firm, Becht Engineering Co. of\\nLiberty Corner, N.J., in a report for Mr. Greenhill. It said the quantity of\\nconcrete, lumber and steel bars charged to the medical center far exceeded its\\nplans and what the charred remains of the center showed had been used. HUD\\nrules specify that the bank account for a HUD project, a blend of federal and\\nprivate funds, can\\'t be used to pay for any other work.  \\n<p>\\n   Michael Barnes, then a HUD economic-development specialist, visited Kiryas\\nJoel in March 1990 to find out why construction on the medical center had\\nstopped and to inspect the project\\'s financial records. He was greeted by a\\nlow-level clerk who had little information. \"I was p -- and said I would be\\nback,\" he says. But a few weeks later, he read about a suspicious fire that lit\\nthe skies over Kiryas Joel around midnight on April 21, 1990, destroying the\\nbuilding. State police found empty gas cans and 17 separate spots where fire\\nhad broken out.  \\n<p>\\n   Besides filing its insurance claim, the village development corporation then\\nsought HUD funding to rebuild the center. And it asked the state health\\ndepartment to continue its preliminary approval for patient reimbursement once\\na center was built. But a health-department official says, \"Our counsel\\'s\\noffice is looking into what went on. Any approvals previously given are null\\nand void.\"  \\n<p>\\n   The state police are still trying to solve the arson. A police\\ninvestigator\\'s report at the time said that \"a confidential informant indicated\\nthe building was burned at the request of people involved in the construction.\"\\n \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Kahan, the man who oversaw the medical-center project and to whose condo\\nproject Mr. Greenhill says some funds were diverted, declines to comment,\\nsaying, \"My English is not so good.\" He refers calls to Meyer Wertheimer, now\\nthe village\\'s director of economic development, who says he didn\\'t hold the\\nposition then and thus can\\'t answer questions about the project. Deputy Mayor\\nWieder says, \"There was not a single violation.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Another resident says he pays $120 a month now for his child to be in Head\\nStart. Once he held back payment, he says, and a person from the U.T.A. called\\nand told him that \"if I don\\'t pay, my daughter won\\'t receive a go-in card.\"  \\n<p>\\n   William Goldenburg, director of the village\\'s Head Start program, says: \"We\\nnever charge a penny; parents know this.\" He concedes that the names of the\\nprogram\\'s students show up on tuition bills the U.T.A. sends to families. But\\nhe explains that \"U.T.A. runs the Head Start lunch program, and their computer\\nmust just print out all the names.\" The Health and Human Services Department is\\nslated to grant the Kiryas Joel Head Start program $827,435 this year.  \\n<p>\\n   Allegations of abuses of low-income housing programs also have turned up,\\nsuch as in a dispute centering on a complex built with Farmers Home\\nAdministration funds. It involves a former tenant, Jacob Weiss, and his\\nex-father-in-law, David Falkowitz. Sidney Siller, a lawyer for Mr. Weiss, says,\\n\"Based on our information, Mr. Falkowitz has rights to a number of apartments\\nand is receiving payment for them.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Such an arrangement would be illegal, says Marlyn Aycock, an FmHA\\nspokeswoman. People who say they have knowledge of the FmHA program in Kiryas\\nJoel say investors typically make tax-deductible contributions of $35,000 to\\n$50,000 per unit to the U.T.A. or a charity of the congregation, entitling them\\nto collect extra rent of up to $500 a month from low-income tenants. Mr. Wieder\\ncalls this allegation \"totally false.\" Mr. Falkowitz denies he owns or collects\\nrents on apartments in the FmHA complex. The FmHA said yesterday that based on\\nreports from its field staff, it is investigating compliance in the Kiryas Joel\\nproject under equal-opportunity and other guidelines.  \\n<p>\\n   The case before the Supreme Court involves the public-school-district status\\nof Kiryas Joel\\'s school for the handicapped. The town sought the status,\\ncontends State School Boards Association chief Louis Grumet, to get aid that\\ncould offset some parochial-school costs. Kiryas Joel initially qualified for\\nfull or part reimbursement of parochial-school bus transportation and an\\nEnglish-language tutoring program. \"The school district is a funding funnel,\"\\nMr. Grumet declares.  \\n<p>\\n   Replies Deputy Mayor Wieder: \"Whoever made those charges is the lowest of\\nlow persons.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Voting has been another sore spot. Two years ago, 150 people signed a\\npetition saying violence here \"makes it impossible to have free elections\" and\\nasking that voting booths be moved away from the synagogue that bans dissident\\nfamilies.  \\n<p>\\n   Congregation Yetev Lev, led by the grand rabbi, then wrote to the signers\\ntelling them to \"repent\" and remove their names or face excommunication from\\nthe Satmar sect and denial of visiting rights to the Kiryas Joel cemetery.\\nChildren of the signers faced expulsion from parochial schools. Most signers\\nremoved their names. The synagogue posted the remaining 18 names at a doorway\\nto voting booths in the state Democratic primary in 1992.  \\n<p>\\n   A resident whose name stayed on the list says that even though the posting\\nwas taken down for the general election, she was afraid to vote. \"Hundreds of\\nboys from the rabbinical yeshiva were there to scare you,\" she says.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Wieder denies there was any intimidation or fraud and says records show\\nall the dissidents voted. Mr. Waldman says that on voting day, he saw\\nrabbinical students practicing the signatures of former students. The Orange\\nCounty Board of Elections says it is looking into moving the voting site but\\nsees no reason to act on Mr. Waldman\\'s charges.  \\n<p>\\n   Just how seriously residents take the grand rabbi\\'s concerns about obedience\\nto his dictates is suggested in a statement given to state police by a\\nrabbinical student in December 1989. The student, Chaim Gottlieb, said he was\\ndirected by two men, including Mr. Wertheimer, to \"hit Mr. Samuel Kaufman in\\nthe head with a rock, because he was renting an apartment to Mr. Israel Wiess\\nsic, whom they did not like.\"  \\n<p>\\n   A supporter of the breakaway school, Mr. Weiss had rented without the\\napproval of Congregation Yetev Lev. The student said Mr. Wertheimer and the\\nother man gave him the stones and then, at 11 p.m., pointed to a bedroom window\\nof Mr. Kaufman\\'s home. The student threw a stone through the window. Mr.\\nKaufman wasn\\'t hurt. No one was charged with a crime.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Wertheimer denies he gave any instructions or stones to Mr. Gottlieb. He\\nalso contends that Mr. Waldman coerced the student into naming Mr. Wertheimer,\\nand that in return for naming him, the student got the charges against himself\\ndropped. Mr. Waldman rejects the Wertheimer account.  \\n<p>\\n   Trouble worsened after Grand Rabbi Moses Teitelbaum ordered his followers in\\na Passover 1989 speech to shout Shygetz, Aroas! (Infidel, Out!) at anyone who\\nsupported the breakaway school. Mr. Wieder says the grand rabbi was merely\\ntrying to \"have peace and tranquility by asking people to leave the synagogue\\nwho did not respect him.\" But the speech became a battle cry for the rabbinical\\nstudents, aged 17 to 19. Reports in the Middletown Times Herald Record tell of\\nharassment, beatings, slashed tires, uprooted plants and smashed windows.  \\n<p>\\n   Children of loyal congregation members chanted the words as they taunted,\\nshoved and spit at students of B\\'nai Joel, the breakaway school. Mr. Wieder\\nsays these students brought such action upon themselves by \"singing songs\\ncursing the grand rabbi.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Rabbinical students went so far as to vent their anger at the widow of Grand\\nRabbi Joel Teitelbaum. A supporter of B\\'nai Joel, she arrived about 1 a.m. for\\nher annual vigil of several hours by her husband\\'s grave. According to a\\npetition to Congregation Yetev Lev signed by more than 100 residents, a large\\ngroup of youths \"jumped out yelling and cursing. They threw rocks large enough\\nto kill a person at her, and into the holy shrine, on the very tomb of our holy\\nRabbi Joel.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Waldman says he was awakened by the shouts and, after calling the\\npolice, raced to the cemetery to find Mrs. Teitelbaum \"crying and shivering.\"\\nThe students, who he believes came from the rabbinical academy just behind the\\ncemetery, smashed her car windows, he says. \"It looked as if the Nazis had\\nsurrounded her,\" Mr. Waldman says. A state-police report spoke of about 300\\nyouths from the boys\\' school who wanted \"several subjects to leave.\" It said\\nstones were thrown at three cars, including that of Mrs. Teitelbaum\\'s\\nsecretary, Jacob Tiernauer.  \\n<p>\\n   Captain James Schepperly of the New York State Police says he is meeting\\nwith community factions and \"we are making progress.\" Village Constable Emanuel\\nFarkas contends that state police used to take the dissidents\\' claims of\\nviolence too seriously because one dissident, Rabbi Hirsch, was Kiryas Joel\\'s\\nconstable at the time; Mr. Farkas says things have quieted down lately.  \\n<p>\\n   But the opposition group\\'s attorney, Michael Sussman, says federal, state\\nand local authorities have underplayed complaints by Kiryas Joel dissidents.\\n\"They view this as an internecine religious thing, where siding with one or the\\nother faction is considered inappropriate,\" he says, adding that he believes\\nthe Satmars\\' voting bloc also is a factor.  \\n<p>\\n   In April 1990, after a demonstration at Mr. Waldman\\'s home that broke some\\nwindows, a state court ordered village Chief Rabbi Aaron Teitelbaum to show\\ncause why Mr. Waldman and his supporters shouldn\\'t be granted a permanent order\\nof protection. Rabbi Teitelbaum replied that while he was a \"witness\" at a\\nlawful demonstration, he didn\\'t throw stones or order any thrown. Complaining\\nthat \"Mr. Waldman has repeatedly denounced me and impugned my religious\\nauthority,\" he nonetheless said he had told congregation members that physical\\nattacks and threats were \"not acceptable.\" Justice Peter Patsalos didn\\'t make\\nthe protection order against the rabbi and his congregation permanent but\\ncontinued a temporary one for several more months.  \\n<p>\\n   Rabbi Teitelbaum says Kiryas Joel is open to anyone, but if individuals want\\nto attend the schools and main congregation they must follow the grand rabbi\\'s\\nwishes. A translation of a speech in Yiddish he made at the main-synagogue\\nsocial hall on Dec. 31, 1989, seems more restrictive than that, however. He\\nsaid landlords would be told that they risked excommunication if they rented or\\nsold to someone without permission from the congregation. Any member ignoring\\nthat rule \"has to be chased as if he were a murderer,\" the rabbi said.  \\n<p>\\n   A year and a half later, a landlord who rented an apartment to the Chaim\\nHochauser family was beaten at the Kiryas Joel cemetery by more than 20 men,\\nthe landlord said in a police report. The Hochausers declined to \"apply for\\nacceptance\" in the community as instructed in a Dec. 12, 1989, letter from\\nCongregation Yetev Lev D\\'Satmar, the Brooklyn-based world-wide congregation of\\nthe Satmars. Before they moved in, it was known that the Hochausers intended to\\nsend their children to B\\'nai Joel.  \\n<p>\\n   An agreement signed by the grand rabbi in June 1989 with developers says\\nthat anyone who builds an apartment \"with no exception\" must pass along $10,000\\nper unit to the congregation for parochial schools. The document called the\\nagreement binding \"by the laws of Torah, and also in secular law.\" Even though\\nMr. Wieder maintains payment is \"voluntary,\" a 1990 contract proposal from one\\nof the builders for a two-family home Rabbi Hirsch planned to erect indicated\\nhe had to pay the $10,000 per unit. By then, Rabbi Hirsch had been thrown out\\nof the congregation.  \\n<p>\\n   Today, the town is filled with suspicion. Kiryas Joel leaders and dissidents\\nalike ask \"who told you that?\" before answering a question from a reporter.\\nSome residents say they are afraid to speak openly on the telephone because of\\na furor two years ago after Rabbi Hirsch\\'s allegations about fraud in the\\nvillage were taped and made public. Illegal tape recordings of his and other\\ndissidents\\' phone conversations were sold in some Brooklyn stores for $2 each.\\n(Rabbi Hirsch says the tape was altered to distort his words.)  \\n<p>\\n   State Police Lt. Preston Felton says some residents are afraid to use the\\nvillage\\'s existing medical offices for fear their records might be made public\\nif they ever got on the wrong side of village leaders.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Kerins, the detective who investigated the medical-center fire, says the\\nlocal phone company told him it had found evidence of \"looping.\" When that\\noccurs, someone\\'s supposedly private line can be listened to elsewhere. An\\nofficial of Highland Telephone Co., which serves Kiryas Joel, declines to\\ncomment when asked if it is looking into possible wiretapping. \"Totally false,\"\\nsays Mr. Wieder when asked about the wiretapping allegations.  \\n<p>\\n   \"It\\'s like Russia used to be,\" says the woman who says she felt intimidated\\nfrom voting. Her children, who attend the alternative school, are constantly\\nharassed by other youngsters, she says. \"I\\'m afraid to let them play on the\\nstreet. Other children hit, shout and spit on them from top to bottom.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Her voice shaking, she says she can\\'t afford to move back to Brooklyn. \"When\\nwe came out here it was so beautiful, the envy of the world. Now it\\'s\\nunbearable.\"  \\n<p>\\n   A SCHOOL run by the Lubavitch Hasidic sect didn\\'t lose its U.S. Education\\nDepartment aid because it filed claims for ineligible students. A page-one\\narticle Wednesday about the Satmar Hasidic community of Kiryas Joel, N.Y.,\\nincorrectly said Lubavitch schools were among those disqualified for that\\nreason.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0105 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0219 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2152 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220100 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> Z.HOL </CO>\\n<IN> I/BLD I/FIS </IN>\\n<GV> G/IGV </GV>\\n<SB> N/FND N/IEN N/PDT N/PZN </SB>\\n<MS> M/FIN M/IDU </MS>\\n<RE> R/EEU R/EU R/FE R/PRM R/RS R/SZ R/UR R/WEU </RE>\\n<HL> International:  Russian Investment Fund Learns  To Play Western-Style \\n    Hardball  ---  Alfa Capital Puts Investors,  Companies Together, \\n     But on Its Own Terms  ----  By Elisabeth Rubinfien and Janet Guyon \\n     Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   MOSCOW -- In less than two years, investment fund Alfa Capital has made\\nitself a company to be reckoned with in the turbulent world of Russian\\ncapitalism.  \\n<p>\\n   The fledgling group has picked fights with numerous companies. After buying\\nlarge stakes, Alfa tells executives how to run their businesses. Those who\\ndon\\'t comply risk a proxy battle to oust management. Those who go along can be\\nrewarded with fresh capital and introduced to potential Western partners, to\\nwhom Alfa hopes to sell its stake for a huge profit.  \\n<p>\\n   To some, Alfa resembles the robber barons of the 19th century U.S., but\\nothers believe tactics such as Alfa\\'s, which include a hefty dose of Western\\ninvestment discipline, are essential to unleashing the economic potential of\\nthe new Russia.  \\n<p>\\n   \"There\\'s a lot of capital in Russia; the problem is the system of\\nintermediaries isn\\'t working,\" says Jonathan Hay, a Harvard-trained economist\\nwho has advised the State Property Committee on privatization since 1992. \"Alfa\\nCapital might be a good intermediary to channel savings of people into\\nprojects, if they treat their shareholders well. Whether they become good guys\\nor bad guys depends on how long-term they are planning.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Alfa is one of the most influential of the voucher investment funds that\\nsprang up when Moscow devised its massive privatization program. Amid a crowd\\nof funds that lure Russian innocents with promises of unrealistic returns, Alfa\\nwas the first to undertake a Western-style audit, recently concluded by Price\\nWaterhouse.  \\n<p>\\n   With 640 such funds competing for investors, Alfa has collected 2.3 million\\nvouchers and about 1.2 million shareholders, making it one of the top three\\nfunds. Alfa finished its first year of operation with a profit of only $200,000\\nbecause of large start-up costs. For 1994, the fund expects to clear $3 million\\nor $4 million after operating expenses but before new investments. Most of that\\nwill be reinvested, but an unspecified amount will be distributed as dividends,\\nAlfa executives say.  \\n<p>\\n   Alfa is opening new offices for retail services and developing departments\\nin underwriting, stock brokerage activities and business and investment\\nconsulting. In short, it may become Russia\\'s first European-style investment\\nbank.  \\n<p>\\n   With the end this fall of the voucher-privatization program, which allows\\nfunds to collect vouchers from citizens and reinvest them in privatizing\\ncompanies, about a third of the funds are merging and consolidating their\\npositions. Alfa now is poised to lead a wave of takeovers that many expect to\\nbegin in earnest as the Russian government starts selling companies for cash.  \\n<p>\\n   \"Eventually there will remain a limited group of professional funds, maybe\\n30 to 50,\" says Andrei Volgin, president of rival Fund Derzhava and chairman of\\na new shareholders-rights association. \"Alfa Capital without question will be\\none of the strongest.\"  \\n<p>\\n   But this is investment banking of a peculiarly Russian sort. From the armed\\nguards who protect the office entryways of Alfa and its parent company, Alfa\\nConsortium, to the lack of laws controlling and protecting the fund\\'s various\\nactivities, investment banking is another facet of Russia\\'s Wild West\\ncapitalism.  \\n<p>\\n   The parent, which includes a bank, art auction house and an investment fund\\nspecializing in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, grew out of a Gorbachev-era\\ncooperative established by Mikhail Fridman and his classmates from a Moscow\\nscientific institute. Though each subsidiary operates independently, their\\nclose ties mean Alfa Bank can invest in shares through Alfa Capital and Alfa\\nCapital can introduce factories to the bank for loans.  \\n<p>\\n   Within weeks of its launch, the Alfa Capital fund embarked on a\\nWestern-style television advertising blitz, and immediately ran into trouble.\\nAs antiforeign rhetoric grew louder in the conservative Parliament of March\\n1993, one of Alfa\\'s initial strengths, having the Austrian Bank Raiffeisen\\nZentralbank Osterreich as a founding shareholder in its management company,\\nturned into a temporary liability.  \\n<p>\\n   Its aggressive investment strategy also drew criticism. \"Alfa has pursued a\\nclever and focused strategy for getting control of interesting companies,\" says\\nMr. Hay of the Privatization Ministry. \"A lot of foreigners who want to buy\\nstakes in Russian companies suddenly find Alfa got there first.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Food, building materials and some large-scale energy and telecommunications\\nproviders make up the bulk of Alfa\\'s 50-odd holdings. \"We invest in the first\\nthings people will buy when a market develops,\" says Michael Alexandrov, one of\\nthe fund\\'s executive directors. \"Not sophisticated machinery, but what you need\\nin normal life.\"  \\n<p>\\n   The holdings were built to enable Alfa to influence an industry. Take\\ncement. Alfa owns controlling stakes in three cement companies plus smaller\\nstakes in five others. All eight are in a holding company managed by Alfa and\\nGornozavodsk, a cement company in the Perm region in which Alfa holds about\\n50%. The aim, says Mr. Alexandrov, is to form a cement concern that will\\ncontrol at least 10% of the Russian market. In June, Alfa reached agreement\\nwith the Holderbank Financiere Glarus AG, a major Swiss cement group, to\\ncooperate on restructuring Russia\\'s cement industry.  \\n<p>\\n   Its first daring investment move was going after the Bolshevik biscuit\\ncompany, which in December 1992 became the first Russian company to go private.\\nThough funds then were barred from acquiring more than 10% of a company (since\\nraised to 25%), Alfa got around this. Its management company purchased 15%\\nmore.  \\n<p>\\n   Bolshevik director Oleg Shimanov was used to production plans coming down\\nfrom the state ministry and he considered himself king of his factory. But Alfa\\ndemonstrated otherwise. It stirred up dissatisfaction among workers, who held\\nthe largest block of shares. After having to force its way into the first\\nannual meeting in April 1993, Alfa launched a 15-hour proxy fight.  \\n<p>\\n   In a series of speeches, Alfa managers asserted that, as shareholders,\\nworkers had new rights. They could demand better performance from Mr. Shimanov\\nand his team. Mr. Shimanov might have to go, Alfa executives declared.\\nEventually, Mr. Shimanov agreed to share control, and Alfa says they can work\\ntogether.  \\n<p>\\n   Alfa can show an even tougher hand.

Fialka  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street \\n    Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   Agents from the U.S. Customs Service have raided the Denver headquarters of\\ncompanies controlled by Oren Benton, one of the world\\'s largest traders in\\nuranium.  \\n<p>\\n   In papers filed in U.S. District Court in Denver before the Wednesday raid,\\nthe agency disclosed that it suspects one of Mr. Benton\\'s companies, Nuexco\\nTrading Corp., may have circumvented U.S. export laws by failing to identify\\nuranium involved in a \"swap\" with German and Canadian companies as originating\\nin Russia. That swap resulted in the importation of $4.8 million of a uranium\\nderivative into the U.S., the papers said. At the time, the quota for Russian\\nuranium imports was \"zero,\" the Customs Service said.  \\n<p>\\n   Spokesmen for Mr. Benton, part-owner of the Colorado Rockies baseball team,\\ndenied the assertion, saying the trade began with Ukrainian uranium and not\\nRussian material. Mr. Benton is Russia\\'s main uranium trading partner in the\\nWest and triggered a federal antidumping investigation in 1991 by importing\\nlarge amounts of uranium from countries of the former Soviet Union at prices\\nfar below the U.S. cost of production. That inquiry led to an antidumping\\nagreement between the U.S. and Russia, but there is no such agreement with\\nUkraine.  \\n<p>\\n   Customs agents searched files on two floors of Mr. Benton\\'s main company,\\nConcord Inc., looking for documentation of what the agency\\'s search warrant\\napplication described as a \"rare procedure in the uranium industry.\" The\\napplication alleged Mr. Benton\\'s trading company imported uranium from Canada\\nafter a Canadian company, Cameco Corp. of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, refused to\\nmake the transfer because it suspected the swap involved Russian material. The\\nRussian material was originally bought by a German company that had paid with\\nuranium it owned in Canada.  \\n<p>\\n   As a result of the swap, 19 shipments of uranium hexaflouride, a gaseous\\nform of uranium that is made to begin the enrichment process for nuclear fuel,\\nentered the U.S. from Canada.  \\n<p>\\n   Fred Boyne, general counsel for Concord, denied that there was any illegal\\ncircumvention involved because the swap had originated with uranium produced in\\nUkraine. \"It\\'s an issue of poor communication among all the parties to the\\ntransaction including ourself,\" he said, explaining that Concord officials may\\nnot have made the origin clear to its trading partners.  \\n<p>\\n   When challenged on an earlier trade by Customs last year, Concord officials\\nasserted that uranium that was suspected as being Russian had actually come\\nfrom a mine in Mongolia, which also isn\\'t subject to the antidumping agreement.\\nBoth deals began with shipments from St. Petersburg, Russia.  \\n<p>\\n   Tom Neff, a senior research analyst at the Massachusetts Institute of\\nTechnology who follows uranium trading, said there continues to be widespread\\nsuspicion within the industry that swaps involving Russian uranium are being\\nused by several trading companies to create a \"massive circumvention\" of U.S.\\ntrade laws that has left the price of uranium severely depressed and U.S.\\nminers out of work.  \\n<p>\\n   As described in an earlier profile in The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Benton\\nhas grown rich trading uranium at a time when industry prices were slumping. He\\nhas also been a conduit of aid to Russian officials, shipping cows and\\npotato-processing plants to Moscow.  \\n<p>\\n   According to the Customs warrant application, anyone found to have falsified\\nimport documents could be subject to a $5,000 fine and two years in jail for\\neach shipment.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0107 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0220 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2322 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220102 </ACCESN>\\n<PAGE> A1          </PAGE>\\n<HL> What\\'s News --  World-Wide </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   PRESIDENT CLINTON ANNOUNCED new aid for Rwanda\\'s refugees.  \\n<p>\\n   Washington stepped up its role in helping refugees streaming out of Rwanda,\\nincluding increased airlifts of supplies to combat a cholera epidemic.

Analysts had been expecting profit in the latest quarter\\nof 50 cents to 80 cents a share. Largely attributable to IBM\\'s effective\\ncost-cutting program and the surge in mainframe sales, IBM was also able to\\nsustain gross profit margins of 39%, defying earlier expectations that they\\nwould slide.  \\n<p>\\n   In its main earnings news release, IBM reported a second-quarter revenue\\nrise of 2.7%, to $15.35 billion from an adjusted $14.95 billion a year earlier.\\nThe 1993 figure excluded revenue of Federal Systems Co., which IBM sold earlier\\nthis year. If Federal Systems is included, the 1993 figure is $15.52 billion,\\nand revenue in the latest quarter would have declined 1.1%, as IBM reported in\\nan accompanying table.  \\n<p>\\n   Jerome York, IBM\\'s finance chief, said in an interview that while he\\'s\\nconcerned about coming product transitions and the \"brutally competitive \" U.S.\\nmarket, he is \"somewhat optimistic\" about revenue growth in the second half of\\n1994 being better than the 4% growth in the first half, after adjustment for\\nthe Federal Systems sale.  \\n<p>\\n   \"Don\\'t go out and tell everybody we\\'ll see double-digit growth, but we\\nshould do a bit better than we did in the first half,\" said Mr. York.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. York told analysts that IBM has now largely sold or written off $600\\nmillion of PCs, previously undisclosed, that were left on the shelf from the\\nend of last year. During the first and second quarters this year, IBM slashed\\nprices across all its PC lines, except the ThinkPad, and took some already\\nreserved write-downs. The price cutting left PC revenue up only in \"a\\nmid-single digit\" in the second quarter, compared with the 20% increase in the\\nfirst quarter and 40% last year, Mr. York said.  \\n<p>\\n   He attributed the oversupply problem to miscalculations and confusion by\\ncustomers over the proliferation of brands in recent years. Mr. York said the\\nnew leadership at PC Co. is in the process of correcting the problems.  \\n<p>\\n   The AS400 line, which showed a double-digit revenue decline in the quarter\\nbecause of the introduction of new PowerPC models, should show \"positive\\ngrowth\" in the next quarter, Mr. York said.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. York told analysts that he was again ahead of schedule on his critical\\ncost-cutting mission. He has taken out a total of $2.1 billion in annual costs\\nso far this year and said he\\'s well on his way to a year-end goal now of $3.5\\nbillion. He said he was raising his objectives by 1996 to annual cost savings\\nof $8 billion, compared with a $7 billion goal he set one year ago. The largest\\ncost savings this quarter came in research and development spending, which Mr.\\nYork cut by 21%. Other savings were achieved through \"re-engineering,\" he said.\\n \\n<p>\\n   Mr. York said earlier that he intends to reduce R&D expense, primarily on\\nthe development side, by $1 billion this year, to $4.5 billion. Analysts say\\nthey aren\\'t disturbed by the cuts, because IBM had lots of expenses to spare.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. York said he didn\\'t know yet if he would reach the previously stated\\ngoal of reducing the work force by 35,000, to 215,000, by the end of 1994,\\nbecause some businesses, like the mainframe and microelectronics sectors, are\\ndoing better than anticipated. In addition, IBM is taking on employees when it\\nwins contracts to run computer centers for other companies.  \\n<p>\\n   With 20,000 employees still to go to meet the target, cuts will accelerate\\nin the second half of this year, said Mr. York. Since last year, IBM has cut\\n15,000 employees, including 8,000 in the second quarter, he said. He discounted\\nany effect the slower reductions would have on overall expense cuts, however.  \\n<p>\\n   Analysts praised Mr. York\\'s success, but said they are still waiting to see\\nwhether IBM can show revenue growth. \"It\\'s a cost-cutting story now. Revenues\\nstill have to be demonstrated,\" said Jay Stevens of Dean Witter.  \\n<p>\\n   The pleasant surprise in IBM\\'s profit picture, which made up for the PC and\\nAS400 earnings gaps, came from the uptick of mainframe sales. Though revenue\\ndeclined 10% because of falling prices, the sales of mainframe computing\\ncapacity, known as MIPs, increased 23%, boosting total hardware sales 2.3% to\\n$7.7 billion.  \\n<p>\\n   For the remainder of the year, IBM will \"sell everything it can build\" in\\nmainframes, Mr. York said. The sales are being helped by a backlash in efforts\\nto switch over to smaller, networked systems, a transition many companies are\\nfinding to be more expensive than anticipated. Improvements in the U.S. economy\\nhave also helped, Mr. York said.  \\n<p>\\n   He said he didn\\'t know whether the mainframe resurgence was a blip, or more\\nsustainable.  \\n<p>\\n   IBM\\'s services business grew 23% to $2.3 billion. Software sales were flat\\nat $2.7 billion. As anticipated, the highly profitable maintenance business\\nfell 3.3% to $1.8 billion, while rentals and financing revenue fell 21% to $841\\nmillion, reflecting the decline in mainframe prices.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0109 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0220 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2255 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220104 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> FBS MFC </CO>\\n<IN> I/BAC I/BAR I/BNK I/SAL </IN>\\n<SB> N/HIY N/TNM </SB>\\n<MS> M/FIN </MS>\\n<RE> R/MN R/NME R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Business Brief:  First Bank System  To Buy Thrift Firm </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   MINNEAPOLIS -- First Bank System Inc. said it signed a definitive agreement\\nto acquire Metropolitan Financial Corp. in a previously announced stock swap\\ncurrently valued at $788 million.  \\n<p>\\n   In the transaction, First Bank will exchange 0.6803 shares of its common\\nstock for each share of the Minneapolis thrift holding company.

Dollar reserves held by the Central Bank quickly\\nfell by some $4 billion. But in addition to draining dollar reserves, newly\\nappointed Central Bank President Antonio Casas (a chum of President Caldera\\'s)\\nkept Central Bank presses working overtime to keep up with the government\\'s\\ncommitments. Banco Latino alone received $3.1 billion from the government, and\\nthe other eight banks received about $5 billion.  \\n<p>\\n   All told, the Caldera administration spent the equivalent of more than 10%\\nof the country\\'s $63 billion gross domestic product trying to bolster weak\\nbanks, and the market quickly lost confidence in the Venezuelan bolivar. The\\nbolivar lost nearly half of its value against the dollar, something the\\nauthorities immediately blamed on \"unpatriotic speculators.\"  \\n<p>\\n   The Caldera government also has created four new ministries, stopped all\\nprivatizations of government enterprises, and lost no time speaking out against\\nthe private sector and warning about the need for price and exchange controls.\\nVenezuela\\'s best known Marxist economist, Domingo Maza Zavala, was appointed to\\nthe board of the Central Bank, and from his first day there he started\\npromoting exchange controls. Displaying a rather astounding ignorance of market\\nforces, the authorities appeared to be genuinely surprised that their\\ninterventionist actions resulted in a screeching halt to private investment,\\nboth foreign and domestic.  \\n<p>\\n   Compounding the capital flight from Venezuela are a rash of populist\\nmeasures that have been taken to temporarily mask the macroeconomic disaster in\\nthe making. Arrest warrants have been issued for CEOs of 13 pharmaceutical\\ncompanies (including those of two large multinationals, Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy)\\nfor price-control infringements. The government has announced the importation\\nof generic medicines from Bulgaria to fill the quickly emptying shelves of\\ndrugstores across the nation.  \\n<p>\\n   The Orwellian Consumer Education and Defense Institute, which acts as the\\neconomic police of the Ministry of Development, carries out daily campaigns of\\nharassment against supermarkets and neighborhood food stores. With television\\ncameras running, Institute enforcers confiscate \"hoarded\" stocks, which are\\nimmediately sold at nominal prices to cheering crowds. Now managers refuse to\\nkeep more than a day or two of stock, which has spiraled costs and created\\nshortages.  \\n<p>\\n   But perhaps the most preposterous action by the Caldera regime was the\\nsuspension of all foreign currency transactions for a fortnight, starting June\\n27. This, in a country that imports 70% of its food. A huge new bureaucracy,\\nthe Technical Office of Exchange Administration, is now being created to\\nadminister the exchange controls. Venezuelans who require dollars have a very\\nlong and difficult obstacle course before them, with all kinds of official\\ndocuments and permits required. These include copies of their last personal tax\\nreturns; commercial invoices and clear proof that prices paid for imports are\\nthose prevalent in the international market; bills of lading; proof that the\\nimports and their quantity are part of the usual transactions of the\\npetitioning company, etc.  \\n<p>\\n   This \"foolproof\" method of exchange controls will, of course, utterly fail,\\nas have all others. If past is prologue, regular businessmen will simply get\\nout of the import business and will be quickly replaced by friends of the\\nauthorities. Price competition will disappear, and the real competition will\\nagain be for bureaucratic favors.  \\n<p>\\n   While officers involved in the two military coups of February and November\\n1992 walked out of prison with presidential pardons, new penalties of up to 10\\nyears in prison are to be imposed on currency and black market crimes. What a\\nstrange message from an elected government! If you are caught in an armed coup\\nand have killed scores of loyal soldiers, you can expect to be imprisoned for a\\nyear or two. But if you buy or sell dollars at a price different from the one\\nset by the authorities, you may remain behind bars for up to 10 years. And\\nyou\\'ll be in jail for as long as the trial lasts, since there is no bail for\\nthe new economic crimes.  \\n<p>\\n   As for the Venezuelan banking community, what the Caldera administration has\\norchestrated amounts to the nationalization of the banking system. Members of\\nthe newly formed Financial Emergency Board are free to transfer liquidity from\\nthe solid banks to the weaker banks that frittered away enormous amounts of\\nmoney by lending to their directors (who then speculated in the stock exchange\\nand in real estate). In other words, the government ran out of funds to keep\\nthe weak, poorly managed banks from totally collapsing, so now it intends to\\nuse the money belonging to the conservative, well-managed banks for the same\\npurpose. This kind of collectivism had not been seen in South America since\\nChile\\'s Salvador Allende, for even Peru\\'s Alan Garcia was not able to\\nnationalize the banking system.  \\n<p>\\n   Since Mr. Caldera is up in the polls -- the common folk have been told for\\ndecades that they are poor because the rich are rich -- price and exchange\\ncontrols will likely be wholeheartedly supported until the people realize (as\\nthe Chileans and the Peruvians did) that there is no work available and no food\\nto buy, despite all the new state subsidies promised by President Caldera.  \\n<p>\\n   In the meantime, freedom of expression is being suppressed. The same Decree\\n268 that established the exchange controls imposes a fine of up to $5,700 for\\n\"promoting\" or reporting on black market dollar transactions. And the lower\\nhouse has unanimously supported a new press law, which in effect takes away the\\ncontrol of newspapers and radio and TV newscasts from the owners, giving the\\nresponsibility to government-licensed members of the College of Journalism\\n(fortunately, the Supreme Court has agreed to hear contentions by publishers\\nthat this is unconstitutional). Venezuela has become, overnight, the second\\nsocialist republic in the Caribbean.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Ball, a Venezuelan journalist, is president of Agencia Interamericana de\\nPrensa Economica, an economic news service for Spanish-language newspapers.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0111 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0220 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2053 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220106 </ACCESN>\\n<GV> G/LOC </GV>\\n<SB> N/EDU N/LAW N/LWS N/RLG </SB>\\n<RE> R/NME R/NY R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Letters to the Editor:  Ethnic Stereotyping  Of Orthodox Jews </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   The June 1 page-one article on Kiryas Joel, N.Y., was an outrageous example\\nof ethnic stereotyping and subtle prejudice.

St. Mary,\\nin Romanian, is equal to Sfinta Maria.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0112 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0220 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2137 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220107 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> AIV CLB F.CLF FLCO FNM GE ICA J.MIB PAO RCL STON </CO>\\n<GV> G/FDL G/HUD G/IGV G/STE </GV>\\n<SB> N/BON N/COB N/EBD N/ICM N/INI N/MOR N/MUN N/STK </SB>\\n<RE> R/AG R/LTM R/SM R/SK R/FE R/PRM R/NE R/US R/NME </RE>\\n<HL> New Securities Issues </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   The following were among yesterday\\'s offerings and pricings in U.S. and\\nnon-U.S. capital markets, with terms and syndicate manager, as compiled by Dow\\nJones Capital Markets Report:  \\n<p>\\n   Federal Home Loan Bank System -- $77 million of bonds due July 28, 1995,\\npriced at par to yield 5.51%, according to MCM CorporateWatch.

Said one person close to Mr. Turner: \"He wants it.\"  \\n<p>\\n   But Turner Broadcasting directors probably won\\'t vote on the CBS matter next\\nweek, according to people close to Turner Broadcasting. Two of the cable\\nprogrammer\\'s most powerful board members, John C. Malone and Gerald M. Levin,\\naren\\'t expected to attend the meeting, which is being held in St. Petersburg,\\nRussia, in conjunction with Turner Broadcasting\\'s Goodwill Games. Mr. Malone is\\nchief executive officer of Tele-Communications Inc., which owns about 22% of\\nTurner Class B stock; Mr. Levin is chairman and chief executive of Time Warner\\nInc., which controls about 19% of Class B shares.  \\n<p>\\n   Other people close to the company also cautioned that putting a deal\\ntogether would be difficult, especially given Turner Broadcasting\\'s depressed\\nstock price. Turner Broadcasting officials wouldn\\'t comment on the agenda for\\nthe board meeting.  \\n<p>\\n   But Mr. Turner\\'s long-held desire for a broadcast network has intensified of\\nlate. At one point this year, he said he was willing to take the extraordinary\\nstep of surrendering his 51% voting control of the company to reach that\\nobjective. Earlier this year, Mr. Turner had serious conversations about a deal\\nwith National Brodcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co.  \\n<p>\\n   But his ambitions have been stymied, in part, by the Federal Communications\\nCommission\\'s cross-ownership regulations, which prohibit media companies from\\ncontrolling a television station and a cable system in the same market. Time\\nWarner has a major cable system in New York City, while CBS owns its TV\\naffiliate there.  \\n<p>\\n   As a result, any serious interest in CBS would likely spark renewed\\nconversations between Turner Broadcasting and Time Warner about divesting Time\\nWarner\\'s shares. Time Warner has said for more than a year that it would like\\nto \"monetize\" its Turner Broadcasting stake, and the two companies have had\\ntalks about ways to accomplish that. Time Warner, however, has been loath to\\nsell its shares and incur a substantial tax liability. With Turner\\nBroadcasting\\'s Class B common stock trading at $18.75 a share, up 25 cents in\\nAmerican Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Time Warner\\'s stake would be valued\\nat just over $1 billion.  \\n<p>\\n   Time Warner, which has three seats on Turner Broadcasting\\'s board, has\\nindicated it would trade the stock for Turner\\'s Cable News Network, according\\nto individuals close to Turner Broadcasting. But CNN would be worth\\nconsiderably more than Time Warner\\'s stock, according to stock analysts.  \\n<p>\\n   Moreover, Mr. Turner has told top executives he wouldn\\'t give up CNN since\\nthat would remove much of the incentive for owning a broadcast network. Turner\\nBroadcasting executives have said they could save between $100 million and $200\\nmillion a year by merging a network news operation with CNN.  \\n<p>\\n   Turner Broadcasting officials also haven\\'t been keen on relinquishing any of\\nits entertainment networks -- such as TBS, TNT or the Cartoon Network -- or its\\nvast film library. A broadcast network such as CBS would provide another outlet\\nfor programming owned and created by Turner Broadcasting and its newly acquired\\nmovie studios, Castle Rock Entertainment and New Line Cinema Corp.  \\n<p>\\n   Time Warner wouldn\\'t comment on any discussions with Turner Broadcasting.\\nBut one person familiar with Time Warner\\'s thinking said that if Mr. Turner\\nreally wants CBS, he might rethink giving up one of his cable networks. \"If you\\nwant a bigger toy, you can give up some of your little toys,\" this person said.\\n \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0114 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0221 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2211 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220109 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> VISX </CO>\\n<IN> I/MDS </IN>\\n<SB> N/BRD N/COF N/PER </SB>\\n<MS> M/NCY </MS>\\n<RE> R/CA R/NME R/PRM R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Who\\'s News:  Visx Inc. Chairman,  Chief, Munnerlyn Quits </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Visx Inc. said Charles Munnerlyn, its chairman and\\nchief executive officer, resigned.  \\n<p>\\n   The company said Mr. Munnerlyn\\'s decision to resign was his own. Mr.\\nMunnerlyn, 54 years old, will stay on as a consultant until at least 1996. The\\nboard expects to name a successor within a few months. Until a successor is\\nfound, two board members, Daniel Kunst and J. Michael Mavrogordato, will\\noversee the business.  \\n<p>\\n   Visx, which makes systems used to treat nearsightedness, also said it posted\\na loss for the second quarter. For the quarter, the company had a net loss of\\n$381,000, or four cents a share, compared with year-earlier net income of\\n$31,000, a break-even level. Revenue was $5.4 million, compared with $5\\nmillion.  \\n<p>\\n   Visx blamed the loss on costs associated with submitting information to the\\nFood and Drug Administration. The company sells its products in several\\ncountries, but is awaiting approval from the FDA to sell in the U.S.  \\n<p>\\n   On the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday, the company\\'s shares closed at $17.50,\\nup $1.25, or 7.7%.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0115 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0221 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2203 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220110 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> BCL </CO>\\n<IN> I/DRG </IN>\\n<GV> G/FDA </GV>\\n<SB> N/CSU N/HLT </SB>\\n<MS> M/NCY </MS>\\n<RE> R/NJ R/NME R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Technology:  Biocraft Reaches Pact  With FDA Concerning  Manufacturing \\n    Sites </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   FAIR LAWN, N.J. -- Biocraft Laboratories Inc. said it has reached an\\nagreement with the Food and Drug Administration to resolve concerns the agency\\nraised about several of the company\\'s manufacturing facilities.  \\n<p>\\n   Based on the agreement, the generic drug company will suspend shipments of\\nNystatin Oral Suspension, an antifungal drug, and the powder for the oral\\nsuspension of amoxicillin, an antibiotic. The company said it expects that\\nshipments will resume soon.  \\n<p>\\n   Previously, the company had delayed shipments of the oral suspension of\\nampicillin, an antibiotic, and amiloride HCL hydrochlorothiazide tablets, a\\nheart drug. The company must prove that its plants are following correct\\nmanufacturing procedures.  \\n<p>\\n   Hemant Shah, an independent analyst, said the recertification process \"is a\\nnightmare for a generic company,\" which could take six to 12 months.  \\n<p>\\n   The company said it also expects to recall select product lots. But it said\\nthat \"given the relatively narrow scope of the recalls,\" the company doesn\\'t\\nexpect it to materially affect its financial condition. But, it said, it\\nexpects to report a net loss for the second quarter because of costs related to\\nresolving the FDA issues.  \\n<p>\\n   The resolution was announced after the markets closed.  \\n<p>\\n   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Biocraft closed at $12.375,\\nunchanged.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0117 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0221 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2127 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220112 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> IBM JNJ </CO>\\n<SB> N/ANL N/NDQ N/NDX N/NYS N/STK </SB>\\n<RE> R/NME R/US </RE>\\n<ST> S/STT </ST>\\n<HL> Abreast of the Market:  Industrials Advance 5.18 in Wake  Of IBM\\'s \\n    Strong Earnings Report  ----  By Dave Pettit  Special to The Wall \\n    Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   NEW YORK -- Several encouraging earnings reports -- including a blockbuster\\nreading from International Business Machines -- pushed stocks mostly higher.  \\n<p>\\n   But investors remained cautious. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 5.18,\\nor 0.14%, to 3732.45, more than 11 points below its high for the day. Declining\\nissues led advancers, 1,111 to 967, on the New York Stock Exchange.  \\n<p>\\n   Stocks focused back on earnings yesterday morning after IBM shocked\\ninvestors with a report that not only reversed last year\\'s loss but easily\\nexceeded Wall Street\\'s profit forecasts.  \\n<p>\\n   Big Blue shares surged 6 1/2, or 11.6%, to 62 3/8, on Big Board-leading\\nvolume of 8.8 million shares. Without IBM\\'s gain, the industrial average would\\nhave been down about 12 points.  \\n<p>\\n   The market languished on Wednesday -- with the industrial average posting\\nits widest loss of the month -- as bonds tumbled on worries that the Federal\\nReserve will tighten credit sooner than expected.  \\n<p>\\n   The Standard & Poor\\'s 500 Stock Index rose 1.01, or 0.22%, to 452.61; the\\nNew York Stock Exchange Composite Index added 0.36, or 0.14%, to 250.06 and the\\nDow Jones Equity Market Index increased 0.90, or 0.21%, to 428.04.  \\n<p>\\n   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 2.26, or 0.32%, to 715.03. The American\\nStock Exchange Market Value Index climbed 0.24, or 0.06%, to 433.24.  \\n<p>\\n   But, although generally positive, this quarter\\'s earnings news hasn\\'t been\\nrobust enough to offset investors\\' nagging worries about interest rates and the\\ndollar. The earnings-driven buying hasn\\'t spread beyond individual stocks or\\nindustry groups.  \\n<p>\\n   \"It isn\\'t of the magnitude that has people saying `My goodness, I have to\\nown stocks.\\' Instead, it has people saying, `My goodness, I should own IBM,\"\\'\\nsaid William Dodge, a market strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds.  \\n<p>\\n   Meanwhile, investors still face the fear they might hold the next stock to\\nbe crushed by an earnings disappointment. Investors in United Technologies,\\nIntegrated Device Technology and Sigma-Aldrich saw that happen yesterday.  \\n<p>\\n   United Technologies plunged 3 7/8 to 62 1/2. The aerospace company had net\\nincome of $1.25 a share for the second quarter. That was up from 95 cents a\\nyear earlier but just shy of the $1.26 estimate of analysts surveyed by the\\nInstitutional Brokers Estimate System. The latest quarter, meanwhile, included\\nseveral one-time items.  \\n<p>\\n   Integrated Device Technology tumbled 7 3/16 to 18 3/4 on Nasdaq Stock\\nMarket-leading volume of 9.5 million shares even though its first-quarter\\nearnings of 47 cents a year matched expectations. The maker of integrated\\ncircuits, though, made cautionary comments about its ongoing second quarter.  \\n<p>\\n   Sigma-Aldrich plunged 5 13/16 to 33 1/2 on Nasdaq after the specialty\\nchemicals producer reported flat earnings of 54 cents a share for the second\\nquarter. Analysts had expected its net income to grow to about 60 cents a\\nshare, according to IBES.  \\n<p>\\n   IBM\\'s profit, meanwhile, reached $1.14 a share in the second quarter,\\ncompared with a loss of $14.10 a share in the prior year and topping analysts\\'\\nexpectations by a wide margin. The estimate of those surveyed by IBES was just\\n69 cents. Big Blue recorded a huge $8.9 billion restructuring charge last year.\\n \\n<p>\\n   Monsanto climbed 1 to 76 3/4 after it reported a second-quarter profit of\\n$2.19 a share, up from $1.66 last year, and above the $2 mean estimate of Wall\\nStreet. Strength in the U.S. and European economies gave a sharp lift to\\nearnings from the company\\'s chemical businesses.  \\n<p>\\n   Johnson & Johnson added 1 5/8 to 46 3/8 after Merrill Lynch lifted its\\nintermediateterm rating on the stock to \"above average\" from \"neutral.\" Shares\\nof the drug company gained 1 1/8 Wednesday following an upbeat earnings report.\\n \\n<p>\\n   Intel rose 1 63/64 to 58 31/64 on Nasdaq. The semiconductor giant increased\\nthe size of its ongoing stock-buyback program by as much as 15 million shares.\\nIt previously had authorized the purchase of 40 million shares. Some of those\\npurchases already have been made. Intel has 413 million shares outstanding.  \\n<p>\\n   Colgate-Palmolive dropped 1 3/4 to 50 1/2. It had net income of 93 cents a\\nshare in the second quarter after recording a four-cent-a-share charge related\\nto the sale of a business. A year ago, the personal-care products maker earned\\n86 cents a share.  \\n<p>\\n   Cummins Engine lost 2 5/8 to 42 7/8. The company reported second-quarter\\nearnings of $1.58 a share, up from $1.32 a year ago, but below the $1.61\\nestimate of analysts surveyed by IBES.  \\n<p>\\n   Smith\\'s Food & Drug increased 1 3/4 to 20 7/8. The retailer had a\\nsecond-quarter profit of 41 cents a share, down from 46 cents a year earlier,\\nbut well above the roughly 34 cents analysts projected.  \\n<p>\\n   Mid Atlantic Medical lost 1 1/8 to 40 5/8 on Nasdaq after plunging 6 1/8\\nWednesday following the release of earnings.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0120 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0222 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2145 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220115 </ACCESN>\\n<SB> N/FIN N/FND </SB>\\n<RE> R/NME R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Money-Fund Assets  Slid by $400 Million  In the Latest Week </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   WASHINGTON -- Money-market mutual-fund assets slid $400 million to $593.33\\nbillion from a revised $593.73 billion in the week ended Wednesday, the\\nInvestment Company Institute said.  \\n<p>\\n   Assets of 669 retail money-market mutual funds fell $712.4 million to\\n$422.56 billion, the trade group said.

Larger funds -- and larger fund\\ngroups -- may not generate better results than their smaller brethren. But if\\nyou stick with the fund industry\\'s major players, you\\'re far less likely to end\\nup with a real turkey.  \\n<p>\\n   \"If somebody doesn\\'t have a lot of time, they\\'re going to be pretty well\\nserved if they go to a T. Rowe Price or a Scudder or a Vanguard,\" argues\\nKenneth Gregory, editor of the No-Load Fund Analyst, a San Francisco\\nnewsletter. \"They may not offer the best funds, but they\\'re a safe way to go.\" \\n\\n<p>\\n   For proof, consider some statistics from Chicago fund researchers\\nMorningstar Inc. For each of the past five calendar years, the firm looked at\\nthe best and worst 25 performers among diversified U.S. stock funds, those\\nclassified as equity-income, growth-and-income, growth, aggressive-growth and\\nsmall-company.  \\n<p>\\n   On average, the worst 25 performers in each of the past five years were over\\n40% smaller than the average fund, based on fund assets at the beginning of\\neach year. A svelte size could also be a virtue, however. According to\\nMorningstar, the top 25 performers in each calendar year between 1989 and 1993\\nwere, on average, almost 60% smaller than the average fund. (These days,\\ndiversified stock funds have average assets of around $500 million.)  \\n<p>\\n   Not only did the best and worst performers tend to be small funds, they also\\ntended to be part of small fund groups.  \\n<p>\\n   Just 22% of the worst 25 performers in each of the past five calendar years\\n-- and only 35% of the 25 best performers -- were from the 39 biggest fund\\ncomplexes, those with total assets of more than $10 billion at year-end 1993.\\nYet these giant 39 fund groups manage 76% of the fund industry\\'s assets.  \\n<p>\\n   \"Among smaller funds, you\\'re more likely to find a fund that soars, but\\nyou\\'re also more likely to get a fund that flops,\" says Catherine Voss Sanders,\\nassociate editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds, which is published by\\nMorningstar.  \\n<p>\\n   \"If you buy one of these funds that tend to make the leaders and laggards\\nlist,\" she says, \"you may not stay with the fund and enjoy the long-run\\nresults. People tend to make more money with larger funds that generate\\nmore-consistent results.\"  \\n<p>\\n   While funds of all size go through rough patches, it seems that when a small\\nfund gets hit, it tends to get hit hard.  \\n<p>\\n   To illustrate that, Morningstar went back over the past 10 calendar years\\nand divided diversified U.S. stock funds into four groups, based on their\\nassets at the beginning of each year.  \\n<p>\\n   The very smallest funds -- those that ranked in the bottom 25% in terms of\\nassets -- didn\\'t necessarily generate poorer results each year. Indeed, on\\naverage the smallest funds turned in the best results in 1984, 1991 and 1992.  \\n<p>\\n   But those averages hid some grim results. Morningstar looked at the three\\nworst-performing funds in each year for the four different size groups.  \\n<p>\\n   In nine of the 10 years, the biggest losers came from the smallest 25% of\\nall funds. Today, that group would include funds with less than $12 million in\\nassets.  \\n<p>\\n   Morningstar\\'s statistics confirm the experience of Mr. Gregory, the\\nnewsletter editor. He says his biggest successes -- and worst mistakes -- have\\ncome with small funds from relatively unknown fund groups.  \\n<p>\\n   \"As organizations get larger, they have the ability to build more depth into\\ntheir management team,\" he says. \"With smaller funds, the managers may be\\nspread more thinly, running the business as well as doing the research. Some of\\nmy biggest mistakes have been in small funds.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Nonetheless, when picking funds that invest in smaller-company stocks, Mr.\\nGregory favors stock pickers who manage less than $400 million, including money\\nin both the fund and other accounts.  \\n<p>\\n   He also favors smaller money-management firms -- those overseeing less than\\n$2 billion -- when choosing a foreign-stock fund.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Gregory notes that funds with smaller assets can be more nimble in\\nexploiting investment opportunities. That can be especially true if the\\nportfolio manager works for a small fund complex. Big fund groups sometimes\\nhave investment committees or research directors that impose strict investment\\nguidelines.  \\n<p>\\n   Of course, flexibility doesn\\'t always lead to good investment results.\\nRichard Fontaine, who used to be a fund manager with T. Rowe Price Associates,\\nquit the large Baltimore fund group and launched his own mutual fund, Fontaine\\nCapital Appreciation Fund, in September 1989. His bearish stance reaped big\\ngains in 1990, when the fund was up 6.1%, while stock funds on average fell\\n6.3%.  \\n<p>\\n   Since then, however, the fund has struggled, because Mr. Fontaine has\\ncontinued to keep a hefty chunk of his fund\\'s assets in cash.  \\n<p>\\n   Since its launch, Fontaine Capital Appreciation has returned 32.2%, vs. an\\naverage 48.7% for all diversified U.S. stock funds, according to Lipper\\nAnalytical Services Inc.  \\n<p>\\n   With your own fund, \"you have the ability to take strong positions,\" Mr.\\nFontaine says. \"But that can cut both ways. You can be decisive, but wrong.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Some small funds generate poor results because of their outrageously high\\nannual fund expenses.  \\n<p>\\n   For instance, Steadman Fund Group, whose four funds often crop up among the\\npoorest performers, levied annual expenses of between 5.79% and 12.66% in the\\nlatest fiscal year. By contrast, diversified U.S. stocks charge 1.24% on\\naverage.  \\n<p>\\n   Big funds have other advantages. With large fund groups, \"you\\'re going to\\nget more-consistent performance in the sense that, if a portfolio manager\\nleaves, you\\'re likely to get a pretty able replacement,\" says Sheldon Jacobs,\\neditor of the No-Load Fund Investor, an Irvington, N.Y., newsletter.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Jacobs also notes that large fund groups \"have so many researchers,\\ntraders and other specialists backing up the portfolio manager, that that in\\nitself would tend to ensure more-consistent performance.\"  \\n<p>\\n   The burdens of running a fund complex can be particularly onerous for\\nmanagers of smaller funds.  \\n<p>\\n   Crabbe Huson Group, a small but fast-growing fund complex based in Portland,\\nOre., agreed last month to sell its mutual-fund operation to Prudential\\nInsurance Co. of America.  \\n<p>\\n   Why did Crabbe Huson decide to sell? The firm\\'s president, James Crabbe,\\nsays that lately the firm has been opening 300 new accounts a day and sending\\nout another 1,500 to 2,000 prospectuses. \"It really is a very demanding process\\nto build the infrastructure to handle that kind of activity,\" he says.  \\n<p>\\n   In selling to Prudential, Mr. Crabbe says, \"what attracted us was the\\npotential for us to run the money and them to run everything else.\"  \\n<p>\\n   After the sale is completed, Crabbe Huson will continue to manage the eight\\nfunds, which together have $400 million in total assets.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Crabbe says the firm was worried that it would build up a large\\nshareholder service operation, only to get hit with a market downturn. In\\naddition, he says that if the rapid growth had continued, it could have become\\n\"a distraction from what people are hiring us for, which is to manage their\\nmoney.\"  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0123 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0222 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2350 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220118 </ACCESN>\\n<PAGE> C1          </PAGE>\\n<IN> I/INS I/SCR </IN>\\n<GV> G/STE </GV>\\n<SB> N/CLG N/EDU N/PFN </SB>\\n<MS> M/FIN </MS>\\n<RE> R/FL R/NME R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Your Money Matters: Weekend Report  ---  Caution Is a Key Lesson \\n    for Investing Classes  ----  By Earl C. Gottschalk Jr.  Staff Reporter \\n    of The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   If you\\'re worried about not having enough money to retire, taking an\\ninvesting course taught by a stockbroker or financial planner at your local\\nhigh school seems like a sensible idea.  \\n<p>\\n   Finding a course to attend certainly isn\\'t difficult. Adult personal-finance\\nand investing classes are booming at high schools and colleges across the U.S.,\\naccording to the American Association for Adult and Continuing Education.  \\n<p>\\n   Almost every school and college offers a number of such night courses with\\nfees that begin at $50 and rise to as much as $600. Early retirees trying to\\nfigure out how to invest lump-sum distributions from company retirement plans\\nare among the growing number of eager students.  \\n<p>\\n   Unfortunately, the quality of investing courses varies enormously. In some\\ncases, investment professionals say, classes merely confuse people without\\nempowering them to handle their own finances.  \\n<p>\\n   Moreover, potential conflicts of interest are common when classes are taught\\nby brokers, financial planners and insurance agents who make their living from\\nthe commissions on the products they sell. Securities regulators report a\\nnumber of complaints from people who have gone to investment seminars or\\nclasses in schools and colleges and lost their money by buying high-risk\\ninvestments recommended by their teachers.  \\n<p>\\n   Missouri Securities Commissioner John Perkins says what troubles him the\\nmost is when people sign up for what they think is an independent investing\\ncourse at a school and end up in a sales presentation.  \\n<p>\\n   \"It\\'s potentially risky for individuals because they\\'re very susceptible\" to\\nfollowing the advice of their broker-instructors or turning over their\\ninvestment decisions to them, says John Markese, president of the American\\nAssociation of Individual Investors.  \\n<p>\\n   People think that because the meetings are held in a high school or college\\ncampus that school authorities have checked on the reliability and objectivity\\nof the speakers, says Mr. Perkins. In many cases, that\\'s not true, he says,\\nbecause school administrators aren\\'t equipped to investigate investment\\nadvisers.  \\n<p>\\n   The biggest problem is that people tend to let down their guard when they\\nhear a speaker in the context of a school or college classroom, says Craig\\nHoogstra, director of financial services for the American Association of\\nRetired Persons.  \\n<p>\\n   That was the case -- according to Florida Comptroller Gerald Lewis -- at\\nSouthwest High School in Miami, which offered popular adult-education\\ninvestment courses taught by former Prudential Securities Inc. broker James P.\\nMcCormick.  \\n<p>\\n   The state of Florida has filed a disciplinary action against Mr. McCormick\\nalleging that he used his position as an instructor to \"establish\\nrelationships\" with students and sell them \"unsuitable investments\" -- limited\\npartnerships in oil, real estate and aircraft leasing. That action, which seeks\\nan unspecified fine and revocation of his brokerage license, is still pending\\nin the Florida Division of Administrative Hearings. The Dade County board of\\neducation has suspended Mr. McCormick as a teacher.  \\n<p>\\n   In a 1991 lawsuit filed in Florida Circuit Court in Miami, six students\\nalleged that Mr. McCormick sold them risky investments after convincing them in\\nclass that the investments were safer than certificates of deposit. Prudential\\nSecurities, a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America settled the lawsuit. \\n\\n<p>\\n   Since the lawsuit was filed in 1991, Prudential Securities has settled\\nclaims with about 100 former students of Mr. McCormick, says Lee Schillinger, a\\nHollywood, Fla., lawyer for the students.  \\n<p>\\n   Prudential Securities denies any wrongdoing. Mr. McCormick, who is no longer\\nin the brokerage business, also denies any wrongdoing. Thomas Grady, a Naples,\\nFla., lawyer for Mr. McCormick, says that when Mr. McCormick sold the\\ninvestments to his students, he believed that they were suitable. Mr. McCormick\\ndidn\\'t do anything improper based on the information he had at the time he made\\nthe recommendations, Mr. Grady says.  \\n<p>\\n   Some claimants said they lost much of their life savings by investing in\\nlimited partnerships and other speculative investments. The plaintiffs included\\npolice officers, a fire fighter, a television news anchorwoman and a former\\njournalist.  \\n<p>\\n   Missouri has also received complaints about investment seminars in school\\nsettings, says Mr. Perkins. New Mexico securities regulators are so concerned\\nthat they\\'ve talked with brokers \"so they don\\'t use these school and college\\nseminars as just a mechanism to sweep people in,\" says Nancy Smith, director of\\nthe New Mexico Securities Division.  \\n<p>\\n   G.W. McDonald, chief of enforcement for the California Department of\\nCorporations, says he\\'s concerned about what\\'s really being taught in\\nsupposedly objective investment seminars and classes but he doesn\\'t have the\\nmanpower to monitor these activities.  \\n<p>\\n   In general, many adult-education investment classes offer helpful\\ninformation about investing, says the AARP\\'s Mr. Hoogstra. But using brokers,\\nfinancial planners and insurance agents as teachers does present \"some\\nconflicts of interest that people need to be aware of,\" says Barbara Roper,\\ndirector of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America.  \\n<p>\\n   For one, there\\'s little doubt that the main interest many brokers have in\\nteaching classes is to \"prospect for clients,\" says Mr. Markese of the American\\nAssociation of Individual Investors.  \\n<p>\\n   Indeed, brokerage-industry publications admit as much. \"Teaching is a\\nprospecting method that works,\" says a March 1989 article in Registered\\nRepresentative, a trade magazine for stock brokers. \"Many broker/instructors\\nestimate they can convert anywhere from 20% to 60% of their students to clients\\nwithout ever pitching a product,\" the article says. \"Students attending a class\\nare more motivated than those attending a seminar, particularly since they are\\npaying a fee.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Of course, there\\'s nothing illegal about broker-teachers impressing their\\nstudents with their knowledge and ability so that they sign up later for\\nprivate services. Accountants and attorneys also conduct seminars and teach\\nclasses in the hope of attracting clients.  \\n<p>\\n   The problem occurs when students \"check their normal skepticism at the door\"\\nand blindly follow advice that may not be the best move for them, says Tim\\nKochis, partner in Kochis & Fritz, a San Francisco personal-finance consulting\\nfirm.  \\n<p>\\n   Sponsoring financial salespeople as teachers of objective material can cause\\nlegal difficulties for school districts. The Dade County School Board was named\\nas a co-defendant along with Prudential Securities and Mr. McCormick in the\\nstudents\\' lawsuit in the Southwest High case.  \\n<p>\\n   The students\\' litigation against Dade County has been settled, but as a\\nresult, the school board has tightened its regulations for teachers of its\\nadult-education classes. Brokers and other financial professionals, for\\nexample, have to disclose annually if any claims or lawsuits have been made\\nagainst them. And each student is given notice that an instructor is not\\nallowed to use that position for personal gain.  \\n<p>\\n   Some investment-education professionals question whether adult-education\\nclasses do much good for first-time investors. \"If a person has never invested\\nbefore, I doubt whether they are really going to get much out of the typical\\nclass,\" says Kenneth Janke, president of the National Association of Investors\\nCorp., a Madison Heights, Mich., organization that sponsors 13,000 investment\\nclubs. \"I don\\'t think people learn about investing until they put their money\\nat risk,\" he says.  \\n<p>\\n   The AARP\\'s Mr. Hoogstra says instructors in some classes tend just to show\\nthe complexity of investing, insurance and taxes without empowering people to\\ntake action themselves. \"The message from the teacher is these things are\\nterribly complicated, and you will never understand them. To get the job done,\\nyou have to hire a professional. Like me.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Financial advisers say people who want to avoid getting burned in class\\nshould pay particular attention to things like whether the instructor\\nrecommends only products that his firm sells, or exclusively endorses products\\nthat pay high commissions.  \\n<p>\\n   A good instructor will encourage further research and different points of\\nview, rather than advocating a pat strategy or the \"company line\" from his or\\nher firm. Instructors should speak clearly and describe investment strategies\\nsimply, minimizing technical jargon; if they don\\'t, it\\'s fair to wonder if they\\nare really trying to confuse you. Is the teacher gathering names, addresses and\\ntelephone numbers of students to solicit them later?  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Kochis of Kochis & Fritz, who teaches adult personal-finance courses at\\nthe University of California at Berkeley, says students can gain valuable\\ninsights from taking the right courses. But, he says, \"It\\'s up to the student\\nto recognize that there\\'s a potential conflict of interest and to retain a\\nhealthy skepticism.\"  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0124 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0223 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2057 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220119 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> G.POR </CO>\\n<IN> I/AUT </IN>\\n<SB> N/CSU </SB>\\n<MS> M/CYC </MS>\\n<RE> R/EU R/GE R/NME R/NV R/US R/WEU </RE>\\n<HL> Porsche Recalls 944, 968 Models </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   RENO, Nev. -- Porsche AG said it is recalling 1,178 1991 and 1992 Porsche\\ncars to install windshield-wiper motor covers.

Two states -- Maine and New Hampshire -- have never\\nhad a seat-belt law. And some states are facing citizen-driven repeal efforts\\nin a battle of individual rights vs. the common good.  \\n<p>\\n   Steve Bianco, 47 years old, set his own business aside to devote himself to\\noverturning California\\'s helmet law. In June 1992, while returning home on his\\nHarley-Davidson from closing the sale of his house, he was ticketed for wearing\\na beanie-style helmet, rather than the traditional full-sized version required\\nby state law. He sued the state but lost on appeal.  \\n<p>\\n   \"I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever been so obsessed with something,\" says Mr. Bianco,\\nwho plans to move to a state without a helmet law and continue the fight\\nagainst such measures. \"I\\'ve never found something so wrong.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Indeed, many citizens groups -- including a vocal motorcyclists lobby --\\ninsist that wearing a helmet or safety belt is a matter of personal choice. The\\nrebelling states want the federal government to stay out of their affairs.  \\n<p>\\n   But the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which oversees the\\n1991 federal law, says saving lives and preventing serious injury is reason\\nenough to tread on individual freedom. And Congress is reallocating highway\\nfunding to drive home the point.  \\n<p>\\n   States without universal helmet and seat-belt laws will see 1.5% of their\\nfederal highway funding -- a total of about $54 million -- shifted away from\\nroad repairs and earmarked instead for safety education programs. If such laws\\naren\\'t enacted by Oct. 1, the penalty will double to 3% next year.  \\n<p>\\n   Federal officials hope this will prod states on the edge into compliance --\\nas it has Kentucky, Massachusetts, South Dakota and Vermont. But most resisters\\n\"have made their decision to take a hit and live with it,\" says Rebecca Brady,\\ntransportation committee director for the National Conference on State\\nLegislatures. \"They\\'re very hardcore\" and are generally fed up with federal\\nmandates. \"They\\'ve reached a saturation point.\"  \\n<p>\\n   The stance could cost Utah about $1 million this year and $2 million next\\nyear, but \"the million dollars be damned; we\\'re not going to have a helmet\\nlaw,\" insists state Rep. Melvin Brown. While Utah requires minors to wear\\nhelmets, for adults \"our citizens have the right to kill themselves any way\\nthey want,\" he says.  \\n<p>\\n   Helmet laws, Mr. Brown declares, are part of pervasive federal involvement\\nin everything from private-property and grazing rights to gun control. \"Where\\ndo you draw the line?\" he asks.  \\n<p>\\n   Massachusetts residents will vote on a seat-belt law recall in November; on\\nJune 14, North Dakota voters decided to keep their safety belt law and its $20\\nfine.  \\n<p>\\n   The threat of losing as much as $3 million in highway funding doomed a\\npetition drive in Nebraska for a referendum on the state\\'s seat-belt and helmet\\nlaws. \"Believe me, that really scared off a lot of people,\" says John Quinn,\\nspokesman for Freedom First in Nebraska, which headed the effort.  \\n<p>\\n   Consumer groups like Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety say personal\\nfreedoms are overridden by public safety. \"You just don\\'t operate in a vacuum\\nwhen you\\'re on the highway system,\" says Katherine Hutt, spokeswoman for the\\nWashington, D.C., lobby group.  \\n<p>\\n   But persuading states to adopt helmet laws is tough. While a 1990 Motorcycle\\nIndustry Council survey found that most riders favor helmet laws of some sort,\\nMs. Hutt said a \"small but vocal\" lobby has kept them off the books in many\\nstates.  \\n<p>\\n   \"If I could get a bill through, I would. But I\\'m very reluctant,\" says\\nIndiana Rep. Dennis Avery, who blames the failure of his helmet bill five years\\nago in part on lobbying by motorcycling groups. The state will see about $8.4\\nmillion in highway funds shifted to safety programs this year and next.  \\n<p>\\n   Dennis Faulkenberg, chief financial officer for Indiana\\'s transportation\\ndepartment, says this year\\'s lost share would have paved 25 miles of highway\\nand repaired six to eight bridges. New lanes and intersection improvements will\\nalso fall by the roadside. Mr. Faulkenberg and other state highway officials\\nsay they feel like innocent bystanders and are asking Congress to drop the\\npenalty for lacking helmet and belt laws.  \\n<p>\\n   \"It\\'s incredibly frustrating,\" he says, \"when you\\'re already strapped for\\nfunding.\"  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0127 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0223 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2135 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220122 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> CIC </CO>\\n<IN> I/INP I/INS </IN>\\n<SB> N/BRD N/COF N/PER N/WEI </SB>\\n<MS> M/FIN </MS>\\n<RE> R/NME R/NY R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Who\\'s News:  Continental Corp.

She succeeds William\\nThiele, who resigned in September 1992 as the company was struggling to recover\\nfrom heavy hurricane losses.  \\n<p>\\n   Battered by other catastrophe losses since, the company said Ms. Tocklin\\nwill put in place plans \"to improve its profitability and financial position.\" \\n\\n<p>\\n   Just last month, Continental announced it will eliminate 900 jobs, or 8% of\\nits work force, cut back on property insurance written in catastrophe-prone\\nareas and buy more reinsurance, among other steps.  \\n<p>\\n   Ms. Tocklin also joins the company\\'s board, as it expands to 15 members.  \\n<p>\\n   The company also promoted Wayne H.

After taxes, that charge was equal to $9\\nmillion, or nine cents a share.  \\n<p>\\n   Bank of Boston\\'s U.S. lending business dropped slightly from the prior\\nquarter, excluding the Bank Worcester unit.

Yeong,\\nmanaging director of the Star Harbor Timber Co. subsidiary who has been accused\\nof attempting to bribe Joses Tuhanuku, the Solomon Islands minister for\\ncommerce, employment and trade. The company said that it is investigating the\\nminister\\'s allegation, adding that Mr. Yeong \"has taken full personal\\nresponsibility for this incident.\"  \\n<p>\\n   The company\\'s announcement comes in the wake of Mr. Tuhanuku\\'s statement on\\nMonday that Mr. Yeong was ordered to leave the Solomon Islands after he\\nallegedly offered a SI$10,000 (US$3,064) bribe to the minister. He added that\\nthe Solomon Islands Prime Minister Francis Billy Hilly has asked the country\\'s\\nattorney general to investigate the Malaysian concern\\'s operations there.  \\n<p>\\n   A Berjaya spokeswoman said Wednesday that the allegation and investigation\\nhave yet to affect the company\\'s US$60 million timber-processing investment or\\nits grant to log in 600,000 hectares of forest concessions. The concessions\\nwere awarded to Berjaya in May by two provincial governments.  \\n<p>\\n   Berjaya\\'s shares closed Wednesday on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange at 2.30\\nringgit (89 U.S. cents), up three Malaysian cents.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Tuhanuku alleged in his statement that Mr. Yeong handed him a brown\\nenvelope in the ministry office containing the cash. The minister further\\nalleged that the executive \"had been demanding a personal assurance . . . that\\nBerjaya would get Foreign Investment Board approval\" to launch the Star Harbor\\ntimber processing operation.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Tuhanuku said that after he declined to accept the envelope Mr. Yeong\\n\"insisted and tried to tell me that it was the accepted practice in the South\\nPacific and indeed around the world for a large company such as Berjaya to show\\nits appreciation to those in government who assisted the company.\" He added\\nthat the executive \"indicated to me that if approval was forthcoming, then I\\ncould ask for any `assistance\\' I might need from Berjaya.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Tuhanuku stated that the incident \"highlighted the endemic corruption\\nwhich surrounds the timber industry in the Solomon Islands. Sadly this problem\\nhas only got out of control in . . . the last five or six years, a period which\\ncoincides with the big influx of foreign timber companies into the country.\" He\\nadded that \"the timber industry really is a curse on the Solomon Islands.\\nEnvironmentally, politically and economically, it is distorting the normal\\nprocess and undermining our sovereignty.\"  \\n<p>\\n   In response, Berjaya said it \"has no knowledge of any such unlawful act by\\nMr. Yeong as alleged by the minister,\" adding that if a bribe was offered, it\\n\"was done without the instruction, authorization or sanction of the company or\\nits management.\" Berjaya added that Mr. Tuhanuku\\'s comment has \"cast aspersions\\non the integrity and credibility of the Berjaya Group and has also imputed\\nimpropriety to the manner in which our group carries on business and in our\\ninteraction with government officials.\" The company added that it soon will\\nlodge a protest \"in the strongest terms\" to the country\\'s prime minister.  \\n<p>\\n   In the meantime, Berjaya said it remains committed to proceed with\\ndeveloping the timber-processing plant.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0130 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0224 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2251 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220125 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> CRTQ </CO>\\n<IN> I/BTC I/MTC </IN>\\n<SB> N/HLT </SB>\\n<MS> M/TEC </MS>\\n<RE> R/CO R/NME R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Technology & Health:  Cortech Ceases Testing  On Sepsis Drug, Bradycor </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   DENVER -- Cortech Inc. has joined the ranks of biotechnology companies that\\nhave stumbled in the race to come up with a treatment for sepsis.

Karene Witcher in Sydney, Australia </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   Kmart Corp. said it agreed to sell its 21.5% stake in Australian retailer\\nColes Myer Ltd. for $924 million, a move that at least temporarily will ease\\ninvestor concerns about Kmart\\'s ability to pay for much-needed store\\nrenovations in the U.S.  \\n<p>\\n   Analysts began speculating that Kmart might sell the Coles Myer stake after\\nshareholders at its June 3 annual meeting rejected a management proposal that\\nwould have raised $600 million to $900 million. The proposal was to sell shares\\nrepresenting stakes in Kmart\\'s specialty-store units.  \\n<p>\\n   Kmart repeatedly denied that its stake in Coles Myer was for sale. However,\\nan investment bank adviser to Kmart in Australia said the two companies have\\nbeen discussing the proposed sale for weeks. Kmart said Coles Myer, based in\\nMelbourne, approached it about buying back the stake.  \\n<p>\\n   Terms of the deal call for Coles Myer to directly buy back shares\\nrepresenting about half of Kmart\\'s stake in the company, and for Coles Myer or\\na designate to buy a Kmart subsidiary that owns the rest of the shares. The\\nmove is subject to approval by Coles Myer holders.  \\n<p>\\n   As a result of the sale, Kmart said it would record a gain in its fiscal\\nthird quarter ending in October. Kmart, which is based in Troy, Mich., didn\\'t\\ndisclose the size of the gain, but last year it valued the Australian asset at\\n$512 million.  \\n<p>\\n   With declining earnings and months of disappointing sales squeezing cash\\nflow, Kmart\\'s chairman, Joseph E. Antonini, has been under pressure to raise\\ncash to pay down debt and fund a $3.5 billion, five-year refurbishment of its\\n2,300 stores. The program is only slightly more than half completed. Kmart also\\nplans to roll out 55 Super Kmart combination grocery-and-general-merchandise\\nstores this year, at a cost of $6 million each.  \\n<p>\\n   In a statement, Mr. Antonini said Kmart directors and managers \"analyzed\\nvarious alternatives\" and decided the sale of the Coles Myer stake is \"in the\\ninterest of both companies.\"  \\n<p>\\n   As part of the agreement, Kmart said it will extend a long-term license that\\nallows Coles Myer to use the Kmart name in Australia and New Zealand. With\\nannual sales of 15 billion Australian dollars ($11.04 billion), Coles Myer is\\nAustralia\\'s largest retailer. Besides operating 158 Kmart-related stores, Coles\\nMyer owns supermarkets, department and specialty stores, and a chain of 89\\ndiscount stores. Kmart has had a holding in Coles Myer since 1978.  \\n<p>\\n   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Kmart shares rose\\n37.5 cents to close at $16.375.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0132 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0224 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940707 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2117 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220127 </ACCESN>\\n<PAGE> R2          </PAGE>\\n<CO> GPF </CO>\\n<IN> I/FIS </IN>\\n<SB> N/ANL N/FND </SB>\\n<MS> M/FIN </MS>\\n<RE> R/NME R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Quarterly Mutual Funds Review:  `Canceled\\' Fund Performs Badly  \\n    ----  By William Power  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   Maybe the \"canceled fund\" should have stayed that way.  \\n<p>\\n   Global Privatization Fund -- a $998 million closed-end fund that was\\nrelaunched in March after its original offering was aborted the month before --\\nhas hit the ground stumbling. It was the worst-performing closed-end fund in\\nthe second quarter, falling 21%, to $11.75 a share, on the New York Stock\\nExchange.  \\n<p>\\n   The fund\\'s initial public offering, at $15 a share, drew a lot of attention.\\nThe first attempt at an offering was rescinded because of an overstated chart\\non privatization performance in the prospectus from lead underwriter Kidder,\\nPeabody & Co. and adviser Alliance Capital Management. Yet the underwriters\\nthen managed to redo the IPO in March at the original offer price. (The fund\\'s\\naim is to profit from the trend in which governments sell shares in, or\\n\"privatize,\" state-run companies.)  \\n<p>\\n   Closed-end funds are like mutual funds, except that they issue a fixed\\nnumber of shares and trade publicly.  \\n<p>\\n   Global Privatization Fund came out just as global stock markets were\\ndropping. The fund is now trading at a 10% discount to its portfolio.  \\n<p>\\n   Fund manager Mark Breedon of Alliance Capital says that the fund\\'s 189-stock\\nportfolio has outperformed its benchmarks and that he can\\'t understand the\\nprice decline.  \\n<p>\\n   Thomas Herzfeld of Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, a closed-end specialist in\\nMiami, calls it a \"very interesting buy\" now. Still, he adds that the fund\\'s\\ndrop proves \"bigger is not better for a closed-end fund.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Michael Porter, a country-fund specialist at Smith Barney Inc., also issued\\na buy rating on the fund in late June, when it had a 16% discount, and says he\\nmaintains that rating. Besides, he says, \"the trend toward privatization is a\\nglobal phenomenon; it\\'s one of the most important themes for finance right\\nnow.\"  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0133 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0224 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2244 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220128 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> CPC IPG OMC RN </CO>\\n<IN> I/ADV I/FOD I/OFP I/TOB </IN>\\n<SB> N/HIY N/MRK N/WEI </SB>\\n<MS> M/CYC M/NCY </MS>\\n<RE> R/NJ R/NME R/NY R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Marketing & Media -- Advertising:  Grey Poupon Softens Snob Appeal \\n     To Boost Mundane Mustard Use  ----  By Laura Bird </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   Pardon me, would you have any Grey Poupon?  \\n<p>\\n   Nabisco wishes consumers would ask that question more often. The strategy of\\nmaking Grey Poupon mustard a premium brand has worked a little too well:\\nConsumers tend to reserve it for special occasions and wouldn\\'t think of\\nslathering it on a plain old ham sandwich.  \\n<p>\\n   So the Nabisco unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. is kicking off a new\\nadvertising campaign to try to persuade people to serve Grey Poupon at ordinary\\nmeals. Grey Poupon \"is already in a lot of households,\" says Larry Benders, a\\nmarketing director in Nabisco\\'s specialty-products unit. \"We want people to use\\nit more, not just at Easter.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Witty ads have depicted Grey Poupon as the mustard of the limousine set for\\n17 years. The commercials, in which stuffy aristocrats pass the Poupon through\\ntheir Rolls-Royce windows, are so well known that plenty of ordinary people,\\nincluding the Wayne Campbell character in the hit 1992 movie \"Wayne\\'s World,\"\\npose the mustard question whenever they pull up next to a limousine.  \\n<p>\\n   One reason the limousine commercials have lasted so long is their appeal to\\naffluent consumers and average working stiffs alike, says Lee Garfinkel, chief\\ncreative officer at Grey Poupon\\'s agency, Lowe & Partners/SMS, a unit of\\nInterpublic Group Cos. \"The campaign said everybody could live the life of the\\naffluent, when it comes to mustard.\" But with simplier lifestyles now in vogue,\\nthat message doesn\\'t mean as much as it used to, he says, one reason for\\n\"opening up\" the campaign.  \\n<p>\\n   New magazine ads suggest that readers \"Poupon the potato salad\" and \"class\\nup the cold cuts.\" One ad with a picnic theme features the signature Rolls done\\nup in red-and-white gingham; another ad about late-night snacks substitutes a\\nlimo for the refrigerator.  \\n<p>\\n   The ads appear in August issues of such magazines as Gourmet, Food & Wine,\\nMartha Stewart Living and Men\\'s Journal. Nabisco is expected to spend about $6\\nmillion on the print ads and is considering a companion television campaign.\\nThe limousine commercials aren\\'t being retired permanently and could run again\\nlater this year.  \\n<p>\\n   Nabisco clearly needs to stir things up. Sales of all prepared mustards\\nclimbed 4% to $252.1 million in supermarkets, drugstores and mass-merchandise\\noutlets during the 52 weeks ended May 22, according to Information Resources\\nInc. But Grey Poupon rose just 0.3% to $44.3 million. Other big brands fared\\neven worse: Sales of French\\'s, the category leader marketed by Reckitt & Colman\\nPLC, were down 2.5% to $68.4 million, while sales of American Home Products\\nCorp.\\'s Gulden\\'s brand were up 0.1% to $20.7 million.  \\n<p>\\n   The new Poupon push comes just as an unlikely new product in the mustard\\ncategory, Hellmann\\'s Dijonnaise, is getting a warm reception from consumers.\\nThe product, which mayonnaise king CPC International Inc. rolled out nationally\\nlast year, combines mustard with mayonnaise ingredients such as soybean oil to\\ncreate a \"creamy mustard blend.\" Dijonnaise sales were up 62% to $27 million in\\nthe same 52-week period, according to Information Resources.  \\n<p>\\n   Dijonnaise wasn\\'t conceived as a mayonnaise alternative, says Lawrence\\nHathaway, president of CPC\\'s Best Foods grocery-products unit. \"Some research\\nconfirmed that people were mixing mustard and mayonnaise already, so we wanted\\nto capitalize on an existing usage.\" Mustard, he says, emerged in research as\\nan \"under-marketed category. There wasn\\'t a lot of innovation or new ideas.\" So\\nCPC took the leap, startling other players in the category with ad spending\\nthat industry executives estimate exceeded $10 million last year.  \\n<p>\\n   The ads, created by Omnicom Group\\'s BBDO, encouraged consumers to use the\\nnew spread on ham sandwiches and hot dogs. They also tried to ingrain the\\nDijonnaise name into consumers\\' brains by inserting it into a version of the\\n1962 pop classic \"Duke of Earl.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Although Dijonnaise lacks the guilt-free appeal of generally fat-free\\nmustards, it may be just the compromise fat-wary consumers are looking for.\\nMayonnaise use on sandwiches is slowly but steadily declining. In 1984, people\\nput mayonnaise on 32% of all sandwiches, including hot dogs and hamburgers,\\naccording to NPD Group Inc.\\'s National Eating Trends food-consumption survey.\\nNine years later, that rate has fallen to 30%. But mustard hasn\\'t taken its\\nplace. In 1984, 18% of sandwiches had mustard, compared with 16% in 1993.  \\n<p>\\n   National Eating Trends traces the drop in mustard consumption to the the\\ndecline of the bologna sandwich. \"At one time the bologna sandwich was one of\\nthe Top 10 foods in the U.S.,\" says company Vice President Harry Balzer. \"It\\'s\\nbeen replaced by turkey sandwiches, but mustard goes better with bologna than\\nwith turkey.\" The rising popularity of tacos and burritos is hurting both\\nmustard and mayonnaise, he says.  \\n<p>\\n   \"Freedom of Vodka\" is the theme line behind the first advertising campaign\\nfor Stolichnaya Vodka, a product of Grand Metropolitan\\'s Carillon Importers,\\nfrom Margeotes/Fertitta Donaher & Weiss, which was awarded the business last\\nMarch after a heated agency search.  \\n<p>\\n   The campaign uses artwork by contemporary Russian artists. The ads will\\nappear in about 75 national and regional publications in September and October.\\n \\n<p>\\n   The campaign, a company news release says, \"reflects the recent changes in\\nRussia while reminding consumers that they are free to make their own choice\\nabout which vodka they drink.\" The slogan appears in stencil lettering across\\neach full page piece of art.  \\n<p>\\n   GREY: Bernie Rosner joins Grey Advertising as senior vice president, group\\ncreative director. He was most recently at Wells Rich Green BDDP working on the\\nFord Motor Co. account.  \\n<p>\\n   LOWE: Paul Hammersley, 32 years old, was named executive vice president at\\nInterpublic Group\\'s Lowe Group, responsible for the agency\\'s Coca-Cola business\\nin the U.S. and internationally.

Warner-Lambert Co. also reported modestly higher earnings, driven by\\ngrowth in its consumer-products business.  \\n<p>\\n   American Home\\'s move is the latest in a wave of cost-cutting throughout the\\nindustry that has resulted in the loss of more than 30,000 jobs. It also\\nfollows actions already taken at the company in its international operations\\nthat will mean another 2,300 jobs cut. Altogether, the 4,300 jobs represent 8%\\nof American Home\\'s employment as of the year\\'s end.  \\n<p>\\n   American Home has been aggressive in controlling costs in the face of weak\\nsales growth, said Mariola Haggar, an analyst at Salomon Bros. \"This\\nrestructuring is an example of their determination to defend the margins.\" In\\nlate composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, American Home\\'s shares\\nwere up 12.5 cents at $56.625.  \\n<p>\\n   After the charge, American Home reported second-quarter earnings rose to\\n$300 million, or 98 cents a share, from $287.5 million, or 93 cents a share, a\\nyear ago. Sales increased 3.6% to $1.98 billion from $1.91 billion a year ago. \\n\\n<p>\\n   Pharmaceutical sales rose 5% in the quarter to $1.17 billion, led by\\nmenopause treatment Premarin, anti-inflammatory products and veterinary\\nproducts. Sales of infant food products, oral contraceptives, the contraceptive\\nNorplant and cardiovascular products declined.  \\n<p>\\n   The company also completed the sale of two businesses, Corometrics Medical\\nSystems, Inc. and Agri-Bio Corp., for a total of $114 million. It also sold its\\nformer New York City headquarters building for $50 million.  \\n<p>\\n   For the first half, American Home\\'s earnings were up 3.9% to $715.8 million,\\nor $2.32 a share, from $689 million, or $2.22 a share, a year ago.

The Toggle Tube is clear and stiff, and has ends that pinch together to\\nhold the coins. Its colors -- red for pennies, blue for nickles, green for\\ndimes and orange for quarters -- are bright. And Toggle Tubes can be imprinted\\nwith company names or advertising messages.  \\n<p>\\n   The tubes are good for the environment, Mr. Abler says, because they\\'re made\\nof 85% recycled vinyl and can be reused up to 30 times. They\\'re stronger than\\npaper, allow users to spot slugs easily and make it obvious if the tube\\ncontains too few coins.  \\n<p>\\n   Toggle Tube is not the first coin wrapper to be made of plastic. Nadex\\nIndustries, Buffalo, N.Y., makes Quick Wrap, a hinged container that snaps\\nclosed like a clam shell. And Brinks shrink-wraps coins in a plastic so tough\\nit has been known to resist both breaking and opening.  \\n<p>\\n   Banks and other users of wrapped coins use billions of paper wrappers each\\nyear. These sell for about a third of a cent each, compared with about five\\ncents for a Toggle Tube. Mr. Abler doubts that consumers will return his tubes\\noften enough to compete with paper on price-per-wrap. But economies of scale,\\nplus environmental and advertising values, should help Toggle Tube become a\\nserious competitor, he says.  \\n<p>\\n   Initial reaction to Toggle Tube is good from merchants in San Luis Obispo.\\n\"It\\'s sturdier, and you can see through it,\" says Chris Beck, manager of\\nLinnaea\\'s Cafe. \"Very pretty,\" says Alex Darian, manager of an Arco service\\nstation.  \\n<p>\\n   SIR ARTHUR EVANS, the English archeologist, would leap from his carriage and\\nemploy his Malacca cane to dissuade workmen from demolishing some fine old\\nbuilding. Alvin Paige carries a camera and asks only that demolition stop long\\nenough for him to cart off, say, an Ionic column.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Paige drags columns and other handsome architectural objects -- gates,\\nwindows, cornices, moldings or doors -- all the way to Springfield, Mass.,\\nwhere he is artist-in-residence at American International College. There he\\nincorporates his salvage into campus buildings.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Paige adorned the front of the college art center with 30-foot wooden\\npillars from Boston\\'s old Masonic Temple.

But the federal government\\nallotted about $36,000 to build each Mer Rouge unit, substantially more than\\nthe $25,000 allowed in Louisiana five years ago.

Continued government pressure on\\ntobacco companies, as well as antismoking sentiment, sustain the bearish\\natmosphere in the tobacco sector.  \\n<p>\\n   Short interest for Ford Motor Co. more than doubled, rising 18.7 million\\nshares in the past 30 days to 35.6 million shares, while short interest in\\nChrysler Corp. rose 2.9 million shares to 26.1 million. Much of the increase in\\nFord\\'s short position stems from a 2-for-1 stock split during the measured\\ntrading period. Analysts also said that short-sellers may be anticipating a\\nslowdown in the U.S. economy that would hurt car sales.  \\n<p>\\n   AT&T Corp., which saw its short interest shoot up 40% last month, continued\\nto attract bearish sentiment. Its short interest nudged higher by 768,299\\nshares since mid-June, to 25.5 million shares. The increase may stem from\\ncontinued arbitrage opportunities surrounding the telecommunication concern\\'s\\npending acquisition of McCaw Cellular Communications Corp. With that\\nacquisition increasingly likely, arbitragers typically would hold short\\npositions on AT&T and \"long\" positions on McCaw shares, analysts said.  \\n<p>\\n   Traders who sell securities \"short\" borrow stock and sell it, betting that\\nthe stock\\'s price will decline and that they can buy the shares back later at a\\nlower price for return to the lender. Short interest is the number of shares\\nthat haven\\'t yet been purchased for return to lenders.  \\n<p>\\n   The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board short-interest\\nratio rose to 6.19 from 5.96. The ratio is the number of trading days at the\\nexchange\\'s average daily trading volume that would be required to convert the\\ntotal short-interest position.  \\n<p>\\n   Average daily Big Board volume was 259.1 million shares, compared with 262.1\\nmillion shares last month.  \\n<p>\\n   Big Board and Amex short-interest positions were calculated for the month\\nincluding the 21 trading days through July 8, with July 15 as the settlement\\ndate.  \\n<p>\\n   The following tables show the Big Board and Amex issues in which a short\\ninterest position of at least 250,000 shares existed at mid-July or in which\\nthe short position had changed by at least 50,000 shares since mid-June.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0137 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0224 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2159 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220132 </ACCESN>\\n<PAGE> B1          </PAGE>\\n<IN> I/ICS I/SVC </IN>\\n<SB> N/LAB N/LAW </SB>\\n<MS> M/IDU </MS>\\n<RE> R/NME R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Lawyers & Clients:  Lawyer With Six Years of Experience,  Top Credentials, \\n    Seeks Job, Any Job at All  ----  By Amy Stevens  Staff Reporter \\n    of The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   Robert B. Harris, a Boston lawyer, is job hunting. And he looks like a\\npretty good candidate. He graduated near the top of his law-school class, has a\\nresume full of academic awards and spent nearly six years as an associate at a\\nprestigious law firm.  \\n<p>\\n   That, it turns out, was about four years too many. Like thousands of other\\nlawyers, Mr. Harris has discovered that good opportunities for attorneys in\\nmidcareer have become virtually nonexistent.  \\n<p>\\n   \"These people might as well be dead,\" says legal recruiter Lynn Mestel.\\n\"They might as well go back to school and start all over again. They\\'d have a\\nmuch better time finding a job.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Ms. Mestel, whose company, Mestel & Co., is one of the biggest in New York,\\nsays she\\'s even had trouble placing former U.S. Supreme Court clerks, the elite\\nof the elite, who have worked at big firms since the mid-1980s.  \\n<p>\\n   The legal profession simply doesn\\'t seem to know what to do with its\\nmidlevel people. Although recent reports have suggested that the recession in\\nthe law business is easing, and some law firms have stepped up their\\nentry-level recruiting, hardly any major firms are willing to hire associates\\nmore than six years out of law school. And partnership prospects at big firms\\nremain dim. At New York\\'s prestigious Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison,\\nentry-level classes have ranged from 35 to 45 lawyers, says partner Richard\\nBronstein. But only five partners were elected last year. \"That\\'s about\\naverage,\" Mr. Bronstein says.  \\n<p>\\n   In the past, good lawyers at top firms didn\\'t have to worry too much when\\nswitching jobs. They could \"lateral in\" at a slightly less prestigious firm,\\naccept a slightly lower salary and get another shot at partner. Or they could\\ngo to a corporate legal department. But now law firms at all levels are swollen\\nwith partners between 40 and 50 years old -- far from retirement -- and many\\nin-house legal departments are shrinking.  \\n<p>\\n   The problem for job seekers now appears to be rooted both in tradition and\\neconomics. Unlike other industries, the bar never developed a tier of\\nvice-presidents or middle-managers. When the recession hit the law in the late\\n\\'80s, several major firms experimented with \"staff attorneys\" and other career\\nnonpartner positions. But for the most part, firms have abandoned the alternate\\ntracks in favor of the old-fashioned \"up or out\" policy: Either you\\'re elected\\nto partnership within seven to nine years or you\\'re fired.  \\n<p>\\n   The financial rationale for the clubby exclusivity is this: Firms generally\\nmake their biggest profits off young, salaried associates, who work long hours\\nand bill at high rates. But partners at big firms say the market won\\'t bear\\nassociate-billing rates beyond a certain level -- said to be about $250 an hour\\nin major cities. At some point, these partners say, associates\\' salary demands\\nrise faster than their billing rates. If the associates don\\'t have the pull to\\nbecome partners, they\\'ve got to go.  \\n<p>\\n   A California lawyer who is getting good reviews at a big firm needs to move\\nto Ohio because her husband was transferred there. Dozens of inquiry letters\\nover the past few months have turned up no prospects. \"Everyone says they want\\nsecond- or third-years,\" she says.  \\n<p>\\n   The problem is even more complicated for those who have been passed over for\\npartnership. A litigator in his mid-30s, whose firm made no litigation partners\\nfor four of the years he was there, says he nonetheless fears the stigma of not\\nhaving made partner.  \\n<p>\\n   This lawyer\\'s good grades from Stanford Law School would virtually guarantee\\nhim a job in the same law firm if he were just starting out. But as a midlevel\\nlawyer, the only job he could find after a year of looking was as an associate\\nat a small firm, for much lower pay and no promise of partnership. During the\\nfirst few years of his legal career, he says, \"headhunters called all the time.\\nThen they stopped taking my calls.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Another lawyer says she feels lucky that she was able to move to another\\nlarge Los Angeles firm -- at a $40,000 pay cut -- after spending eight years at\\na firm and not making partner. Her new job gives her the salary and seniority\\nof a person who graduated from law school five years after she did. \"I actually\\nfelt a little comfort in being bumped down a few years,\" she says. \"Now it will\\nbe a few years before I come up again\" for partnership consideration.  \\n<p>\\n   Others aren\\'t so lucky and wind up taking the risky route of solo practice\\nor leaving the legal practice altogether. Some don\\'t find work at all. Neither\\nthe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics nor the American Bar Association keep\\nstatistics by age for unemployed lawyers, but the anecdotal evidence is\\ndisturbing.  \\n<p>\\n   Marilyn Tucker, director of career services at Georgetown University\\'s law\\nschool, says she\\'s getting far more calls than ever before from alumni six to\\n10 years out of school. Ms. Mestel, the New York recruiter, says her computer\\nshows 460 job listings for law-school alumni of the classes from 1990 through\\n1992. But she has only 144 listings for graduates from 1983 to 1987.  \\n<p>\\n   And there\\'s always a ready pool of younger associates coming up through the\\nranks. Last year, according to the ABA, 39,425 law degrees were awarded\\nnationwide, up from 38,800 the year before.  \\n<p>\\n   Robert Loeffler, a partner in the Washington office of San Francisco\\'s\\nMorrison & Foerster, acknowledges that senior associates are often more\\nefficient than their less experienced counterparts. But, he says, keeping them\\naround too long would \"create a hardening of the arteries by removing an\\nopportunity for a younger person.\" Partners at other firms also note that\\nbringing in midlevel lawyers might cause resentment among associates who have\\ncome up through the ranks and are competing for a few partnership slots.  \\n<p>\\n   Because of such thinking, law is one of the few fields where young\\nprofessionals become less marketable as they get more experience. Los Angeles\\nlegal recruiter Randi Frisch says firms often claim they like to train their\\nown employees, rather than hiring experienced lawyers who have worked\\nelsewhere. In part, she says, they are responding to clients\\' \"reluctance to\\npay the higher rates of a midlevel or senior associate, if the person is an\\nunknown quantity.\"  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0138 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0225 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 1936 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220133 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> GREY IPG </CO>\\n<IN> I/ADV </IN>\\n<SB> N/COF N/HIY N/MRK N/PER </SB>\\n<MS> M/CYC </MS>\\n<RE> R/NME R/NY R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Marketing & Media:  Ad Notes.... </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   GREY: Bernie Rosner joins Grey Advertising as senior vice president, group\\ncreative director.

Douglas Harris, senior deputy comptroller for\\ncapital markets, said some banks \"have taken substantial hits,\" or losses, on\\nthese notes, although not big enough to threaten their capital positions.  \\n<p>\\n   The advisory warns banks to be especially careful about purchases in the\\nsecondary market, saying that the notes\\' complexity causes them to have \"very\\npoor liquidity,\" possibly resulting in significant pricing discrepancies.  \\n<p>\\n   Structured notes are debt securities whose interest rate, redemption amount,\\nor stated maturity depends on one or more indexes. The notes also can have\\nembedded forward and option features that allow underwriters to create an\\nendless number of risk-reward profiles. Government-related enterprises such as\\nthe Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the Federal National Mortgage Association and\\nthe Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. are the main sellers of these instruments.\\n \\n<p>\\n   The Bank Board has about $56 billion in structured notes outstanding,\\naccording to a spokesman for the Federal Housing Finance Board, which regulates\\nthe system. He said the system\\'s Office of Finance demands that dealers sell\\nits structured notes only to suitable investors and agrees with the\\ncomptroller\\'s advisory. Fannie Mae, the largest of the government-sponsored\\nenterprises, has $4 billion or so in structured notes outstanding. Freddie Mac\\nhas about $8 billion in structured-debt securities outstanding.  \\n<p>\\n   Separately, the Working Group on Financial Markets headed by Treasury\\nSecretary Lloyd Bentsen gave short shrift to the General Accounting Office\\'s\\nwarning that taxpayers could end up footing the bill for a derivatives-led\\nfinancial mess. \"Nothing can eliminate the possibility that a derivatives\\ndealer, whether or not regulated, could fail,\" the group told Congress. \"Even\\nif such a failure were to occur, however, it is unlikely to place taxpayers at\\nrisk.\"  \\n<p>\\n   The working group, which comprises the Treasury, Federal Reserve, Securities\\nand Exchange Commission, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said it \"has\\nnot identified a need for legislation at this time.\" SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt\\nsaid in a separate report that his agency is working with major derivatives\\ndealers to develop an oversight framework for derivatives, and expects\\npreliminary results in the fall.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0141 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0225 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2319 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220136 </ACCESN>\\n<GV> G/IGV </GV>\\n<RE> R/EEU R/EU R/FE R/PRM R/RS R/UR </RE>\\n<HL> International:  Solzhenitsyn Returns  To Moscow, Ending  His 20 \\n    Years of Exile  ---  How Much Influence Writer  Will Have Is Questioned \\n     Following Tour of Russia  ----  By Neela Banerjee  Staff Reporter \\n    of The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   MOSCOW -- Under a brooding sky and before a throng of several thousand\\ncurious Muscovites, Alexander Solzhenitsyn stepped off a train and ended his 20\\nyears of exile from Russia\\'s capital.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Solzhenitsyn\\'s arrival in Moscow marked the conclusion of his eight-week\\nwhistlestop tour through Russia since landing in Vladivostok on May 27.  \\n<p>\\n   \"I have spoken to teachers and students and scientists, to farmers and\\ncollectivefarm workers and entrepreneurs,\" he told a crowd by the train\\nplatform. \"I have written down everything they told me. I remember all their\\nadvice. I hope to take all this to those in power and influence.\"  \\n<p>\\n   What kind of influence Mr. Solzhenitsyn himself will have on the nation\\nremains to be seen. On the dais at the Yaroslavsky Station, he repeated past\\nassertions that he will steer clear of political posts and remain a writer.  \\n<p>\\n   \"He won\\'t be able to do much here, but you can believe in him,\" said\\n27-year-old Marianna Nikolayeva, who was on hand to greet Mr. Solzhenitsyn.\\n\"There\\'s no one else to believe in.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Still, many politicians believe that Mr. Solzhenitsyn has enormous cachet\\namong Russians. The tug-of-war over Russia\\'s most revered writer began even\\nbefore his train arrived. President Boris Yeltsin announced that he soon will\\nhave an audience with Mr. Solzhenitsyn. Parliamentarian Nikolai Baburin, a\\nleader of the nationalist Russian Path party, said Mr. Solzhenitsyn \"will\\nclearly align with the patriotic opposition,\" according to the Itar-Tass news\\nservice.  \\n<p>\\n   While it is unlikely given his independent streak that Mr. Solzhenitsyn will\\nactually join a party, he has emerged as a harsh critic of Russia\\'s changes and\\nits Western-oriented government. \"Today, Russia faces enormous, heavy\\nmisfortunes,\" Mr. Solzhenitsyn said. \"The government isn\\'t fulfilling its\\nobligations to the people. People in the countryside work for nothing.\\nBusinesses have suffered catastrophic blows.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Rain began to fall as he started to speak. The crush of about 4,000\\nonlookers on the train platform, most of them middleaged, thinned to a crowd of\\nseveral hundred by the dais. Standing amid brown puddles, the smell of\\ncigarette smoke and bread baking at a nearby factory in the air, people\\nstrained to hear Mr. Solzhenitsyn\\'s voice over the bad sound system.  \\n<p>\\n   On the edges of the crowd, an argument erupted as an older man hissed\\n\"traitor\" while walking by. Indeed, Mr. Solzhenitsyn\\'s role in Russia\\'s past is\\nmuch more hotly debated than his role in its future. \"What was he doing all\\nthese years? Where was he during the tragedy of last October when the country\\nwas burning?\" complained Eduard Limonov, a nationalist author, as shouts of\\n\"Hurrah\" went up around him for Mr. Solzhenitsyn.  \\n<p>\\n   More than anything, the small turnout for his return underscored the fact\\nthat most of Moscow couldn\\'t be bothered. \"A lot of money went into this\\nwelcome that could have been used for something else,\" said Vasya, a\\n21-year-old luggage handler lolling in front of the station, smoking. \"I have\\nnever read anything of his and have no interest in reading it.\"  \\n<p>\\n   That indifference or skepticism about Mr. Solzhenitsyn\\'s place in Russia\\ntoday may be healthy, some believe. \"People need to see that everything depends\\non each one of us and not on Solzhenitsyn,\" says columnist Andrei Nemzer, of\\nthe newspaper Sevodnya.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0142 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0225 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2255 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220137 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> U.WCM WEL </CO>\\n<IN> I/DRG </IN>\\n<SB> N/ERP N/STK </SB>\\n<MS> M/NCY </MS>\\n<RE> R/EU R/UK R/WEU </RE>\\n<HL> International:  Forecast by Wellcome  Causes Stock to Fall 2% </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   LONDON -- British drug maker Wellcome PLC, failing again to dispel doubts\\nabout future growth of key medicines, offered a guarded forecast for the last\\nsix months of the year and saw its stock tumble 2% in jittery London trading.  \\n<p>\\n   Wellcome\\'s second 1994 interim report -- this time covering the first 10\\nmonths of an extended 16-month fiscal year -- contained conflicting signals for\\ninvestors. Wellcome is changing accounts to a calender-year basis from the\\nprevious financial year that ended August 30.  \\n<p>\\n   Pretax profit for the 10-month period ended June 30 was virtually flat at\\n#488.1 million ($754.4 million) as a hefty #58 million restructuring charge\\noffset burgeoning sales of flagship antiherpes drug Zovirax. Wellcome\\'s overall\\nsales rose at an underlying rate of 8% to #1.77 billion.  \\n<p>\\n   However, during the latest abbreviated reporting period -- the four months\\nended June 30 -- pretax profit climbed 10% while underlying sales spurted 13%.\\nNonetheless, Wellcome predicted that for the final six months of this year,\\nunderlying sales growth would slow to single digits.  \\n<p>\\n   Disappointed investors sent Wellcome stock tumbling 12 pence to 603 pence\\n($9.32) in heavy London trading. The setback wiped out much of the recent gains\\nfrom market speculation that Wellcome might become a takeover target in the\\nwave of drug-industry consolidation.

Gold for\\nAugust delivery ended the day on the Commodity Exchange at $384.30 an ounce,\\ndown $1.30.  \\n<p>\\n   \"The backdrop to this market is continuing concern over higher interest\\nrates,\" said Bernard Savaiko, senior analyst at PaineWebber Inc. in New York.\\nMr. Greenspan\\'s remarks to Congress Wednesday were interpreted by the market as\\nmeaning more interest-rate increases could lie ahead, a move Mr. Savaiko said\\nwould curtail both speculative and industrial demand for silver.  \\n<p>\\n   \"Silver already is losing more speculative investors day by day, and is\\nquite vulnerable,\" he said. \"Higher rates could slow the economy, which would\\nhurt commercial demand.\" Silver\\'s commercial markets include photography and\\nthe automotive industry, where it is a key component in electronic systems,\\nsuch as the power windows installed in cars.  \\n<p>\\n   \"The metal\\'s failure to break above $5.40 in morning trading was seen in a\\nnegative light by the market,\" said Fred Demler, metals economist at E, D & F\\nMan, a New York-based commodity brokerage firm. \"It\\'s tested that level several\\ntimes recently, and can\\'t seem to break higher.\"  \\n<p>\\n   The dollar\\'s strength didn\\'t help matters, analysts note. Increases in the\\nvalue of the dollar erode the attraction that dollar-denominated silver has\\nheld for foreign investors in recent weeks, they explained.  \\n<p>\\n   \"There are no long-term trends in precious-metals markets right now,\" said\\nScott Meyers, senior technical analyst at Redel Trading Ltd. in New York. \"If\\nyou know how to get in and out of the market efficiently, you can make money,\"\\nhe added. \"But the metals seem unable to break out of these trading ranges.\"  \\n<p>\\n<p>\\n   COFFEE: Coffee futures staged what analysts described as a technical rebound\\nafter several days of plummeting prices. On New York\\'s Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa\\nExchange, coffee for September delivery ended at $2.2920, up 8.65 cents.\\n\"There\\'s a lull in the news right now, and the selling just seemed to taper\\noff,\" said Michael Whalen, an analyst with Cargill Investor Services Inc. in\\nNew York. \"We\\'re at a crossroads right now and the next bit of news should give\\nus direction.\" Mr. Whalen added that a flurry of buying by investors seeking to\\ncover short positions, or bets that coffee futures would post further declines,\\nmay have \"exaggerated\" the price gains yesterday. Analysts and investors will\\nbe watching weather patterns in Brazil, where another cold front could hit some\\nof the coffee-growing regions already hurt by two successive frosts in the past\\nmonth. Next Tuesday, the Brazilian government is set to release the first\\nofficial estimates of damages to the coffee crop, a figure which the market\\nwill be watching closely. Most expect the loss to next year\\'s crop to amount to\\nsomewhere between seven and 15 million bags of coffee beans, with most\\nestimates around 10 million bags. Before the frosts, analysts had expected a\\nBrazilian crop of about 28 million bags in 1995, with each bag weighing 60\\nkilograms, or about 132 pounds.  \\n<p>\\n   GRAINS: Grain prices continued to fall on reports of rainfall in central\\nIllinois, one of the few areas of farmland that had remained hot and dry.\\n\"There\\'s the promise of more rain next week, and the likelihood of perfect\\ngrowing conditions continuing,\" said Dale Gustafson, an analyst with Smith\\nBarney Inc. in Chicago. After the expiration of the July corn and soybean\\ncontracts on the Chicago Board of Trade Wednesday, commercial buyers are still\\nunwilling to accept delivery of old-crop stocks in anticipation of bumper\\ncrops. Mr. Whalen reported that commercial interests were net sellers in both\\nthe cash and futures markets. \"There are a lot of soybeans in circulation right\\nnow that no one appears to want to buy,\" he added. On the Chicago Board of\\nTrade, November soybeans closed at $5.5675 a bushel, down 1.25 cents, with the\\nnearer-term contracts posting declines of as much as 9.2 cents. The December\\ncorn contract ended at $2.180 a bushel, down 2.25 cents. Red winter wheat also\\ndropped, with the December contract falling 3.75 cents to $3.380 a bushel.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0144 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0225 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 1938 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220139 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> GREY GRM U.GEM </CO>\\n<IN> I/ADV I/FOD I/OFP </IN>\\n<SB> N/MRK </SB>\\n<MS> M/CYC M/NCY </MS>\\n<RE> R/EU R/NME R/NY R/UK R/US R/WEU </RE>\\n<HL> Marketing & Media:  New Stoli Ads </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   \"Freedom of Vodka\" is the theme line behind the first advertising campaign\\nfor Stolichnaya Vodka, a product of Grand Metropolitan\\'s Carillon Importers,\\nfrom Margeotes/Fertitta Donaher & Weiss, which was awarded the business last\\nMarch after a heated agency search.  \\n<p>\\n   The campaign uses artwork by contemporary Russian artists.

Brauchli  Staff Reporter \\n    of The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   HONG KONG -- When Beijing\\'s top official responsible for Hong Kong visited\\nrecently, he dodged reporters, secretly met with influential China loyalists\\nand warned businesspeople to stay out of politics.  \\n<p>\\n   Standard tactics, pro-democracy forces in Hong Kong complain, of an\\nauthoritarian state. Misrepresentations of Beijing\\'s earnest efforts to\\npreserve stability in Hong Kong, retort pro-China activists.  \\n<p>\\n   With less than three years remaining before this frenetic British colony of\\nalmost six million people reverts to Chinese rule, the debate over Hong Kong\\'s\\nfuture is sharpening. The seldom-discussed crux is Deng Xiaoping\\'s promise to\\nHong Kong: \"One country, two systems.\"  \\n<p>\\n   The concept, that Hong Kong will be allowed to preserve its freewheeling\\nways for 50 years after it becomes a part of nominally communist China, poses a\\nconundrum. Privately, analysts and some political figures in Hong Kong argue\\nthat such antithetical systems can\\'t coexist.  \\n<p>\\n   \"A free-market economy depends on a free flow of information and individual\\nindependence to make decisions,\" says a diplomat here. \"The Chinese Communist\\ngovernment still depends on complete control.\"  \\n<p>\\n   But the paradox is seldom commented on openly by political figures in the\\ncolony. Even last month, when the colony\\'s Legislative Council decided over\\nBeijing\\'s ferocious objections to increase its number of elected members,\\nneither China nor Britain challenged the \"one country, two systems\" axiom.  \\n<p>\\n   \"I think there\\'s sufficient momentum of commitment to Hong Kong\\'s pluralism\\nand values for them to survive,\" the colony\\'s Gov. Chris Patten, who introduced\\nthe democracy measures, said in an interview yesterday. \"And I believe that\\nChina will increasingly recognize that Hong Kong\\'s way isn\\'t a threat and that\\nit can be accommodated in China as a whole and for the good of China as a\\nwhole.\"  \\n<p>\\n   He declined to comment on whether the economic and political systems of Hong\\nKong and China are ultimately compatible or contradictory, saying: \"I think\\ngovernors should practice self-censorship.\"  \\n<p>\\n   The governor\\'s rivals in Hong Kong\\'s pro-China camp believe there isn\\'t any\\nconflict. Some compare the \"one country, two systems\" plan to the varying\\napplication of laws or punishments, such as the death penalty, in different\\nU.S. states.  \\n<p>\\n   \"It\\'s not a simple concept for a lot of people here to understand,\" said\\nCarson Wen, a lawyer, member of many Chinese groups and an appointed adviser to\\nBeijing on Hong Kong affairs. But, he said in an interview, \"I believe the will\\nis 100% there\" to make the systems compatible.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Wen noted that China is adapting more and more free-market ways, with a\\ngradual reduction of the state\\'s holdings in business and an opening of China\\'s\\neconomy. Soon, he said: \"China itself will be two very, very different systems.\\nNot China vs. Hong Kong, but one part of China and another part of China.\"  \\n<p>\\n   To one diplomat, the description of such a dichotomy is tacit\\nacknowledgement of the irreconcilable gap between a free-market system and\\nChina\\'s centralized political structure. Even something as innocuous as\\nuniversity education illustrates the clash: China\\'s roaring economy will need\\nmore educated workers, but Beijing resists expanding the country\\'s cohort of\\nuniversity students, fearing an expansion of the politically attuned\\nintellectual class.  \\n<p>\\n   Fears that China won\\'t be able to restrain its authoritarian instincts may\\nbe diluting confidence in Hong Kong. The visit by the senior Chinese official,\\nLu Ping, was considered a public-relations flop even by some pro-China figures.\\nAlso damaging was the jailing of a Hong Kong reporter for 12 years after he was\\nconvicted in Beijing of stealing state secrets. Then, this month, Chinese\\nofficials had to apologize for bullying a newspaper owner.  \\n<p>\\n   \"People in Hong Kong ask questions about freedom of speech in the future,\"\\nsaid Gov. Patten. \"Civil servants ask questions about their future.\" This\\nmonth, the second stage of a British-passport offer for civil servants was\\nvastly oversubscribed; the first stage last year had been all but ignored.  \\n<p>\\n   \"The only real reassurance can come from senior Chinese officials . . .\\nthrough deeds like cooperation and some words that indicate an understanding\\nthat Hong Kong isn\\'t just an economic laboratory,\" Mr. Patten said.  \\n<p>\\n   But Mr. Wen retorted that Beijing is prepared to play by Hong Kong\\'s rules.\\nEven though China opposed Mr. Patten\\'s proposals to expand the voter base in\\nHong Kong and has vowed to rescind the measures in 1997, its allies intend to\\ncontest pending elections. And Mr. Wen said he will soon announce formation of\\na pro-China, pro-business political party.  \\n<p>\\n   \"You have to take what you get,\" he said. \"Either you totally abstain from\\nthe elections, which means you are left out of the process, or you take part in\\nthe system.\"  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0146 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0225 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2206 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220141 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> X.LYL </CO>\\n<IN> I/INP I/INS </IN>\\n<SB> N/LAW N/SPT </SB>\\n<MS> M/FIN </MS>\\n<RE> R/EU R/NME R/UK R/US R/WEU </RE>\\n<HL> The Business of Law:  Law Note... </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   ARRAIGNMENT: Boxing promoter Don King pleaded not guilty at his arraignment\\non a nine-count federal indictment alleging that he filed a false insurance\\nclaim with Lloyd\\'s of London for $350,000.

The other G-7 nations are Japan, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and\\nCanada. But Mr. Summers, speaking before a Senate subcommittee, also played\\ndown the link between a weak dollar and inflationary pressures -- a statement\\nthat could just as easily have prompted a sell-off, asserted Dorit Ronnen, a\\ntrader at Bank Leumi Trust Co. in New York.  \\n<p>\\n   \"There were conflicting statements from various people, but the market chose\\nto focus on the bullish comments and went with them,\" Ms. Ronnen said.  \\n<p>\\n   Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.5920 marks, up from 1.5645\\nmarks late Wednesday in New York. The U.S. currency also was changing hands at\\n99.13 yen, up from 98.65 yen. Sterling was trading at $1.5235, down from\\n$1.5450. About noon Friday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 1.5888 marks and\\nat 99.13 yen; sterling was at $1.5265.  \\n<p>\\n   But the confusion didn\\'t begin or end with Mr. Summers, analysts said.\\nEarlier, Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, Germany\\'s central bank,\\nhad traders puzzling over his assertion that a strong dollar is in everyone\\'s\\ninterest, but that \"naturally I\\'m interested in a strong D-mark as well.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Tietmeyer was speaking at a news conference held soon after the German\\ncentral bank announced its decision to keep its ceiling Lombard rate at 6% and\\nfloor discount rate at 4.50%.  \\n<p>\\n   The Bundesbank also said it will trim its closely watched securities\\nrepurchase, or repo, rate by three basis points to 4.85% next week, adding that\\nit will fix repos at that rate for the next four weeks.  \\n<p>\\n   The German central bank\\'s moves boded poorly for the anticipated crossover\\nof U.S. and German interest rates, and helped push the dollar to an intraday\\nlow of 1.5560 marks near the opening of the New York market.  \\n<p>\\n   With the Bundesbank opting against a significant rate cut, \"it set us up for\\na lower dollar on the basic fundamentals that German interest rates aren\\'t\\ngoing to come down,\" said David DeRosa, director of foreign-exchange trading at\\nSwiss Bank Corp. in New York.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. DeRosa said the subsequent dollar rally was so powerful largely because\\nmany players took short dollar positions after the Bundesbank\\'s announcement.\\nAnd then Mr. Summers provided the ammunition needed to catch the market off\\nguard.  \\n<p>\\n   Gert Haller, Germany\\'s state secretary for finance, later reinforced the\\nmessage, saying that Germany \"has no interest in a weakening dollar\" -- though\\nhe added that the weak dollar didn\\'t pose any threat to Germany\\'s economic\\nrecovery.  \\n<p>\\n   \"It seemed like one person after another seemed to be making some kind of\\ndollar-positive comment,\" Mr. DeRosa said, noting that \"the success of the\\ncoordinated jawboning\" fed into \"high volume trading and panic liquidation of\\nshort positions.\"  \\n<p>\\n   The mark\\'s weakness in the face of the dollar buying was especially apparent\\nin the mark-yen cross rate. The mark traded at 62.29 yen late in New York, down\\nsharply from 63.04 yen late Wednesday.  \\n<p>\\n   Dennis Pettit, foreign-exchange manager for the Long-Term Credit Bank of\\nJapan, argued that continuing problems in U.S.-Japan trade negotiations point\\nto more dollar weakness against the yen.  \\n<p>\\n   He said the market is especially jittery over talks about reforming Japanese\\ngovernment procurement. U.S. trade officials have set a July 31 deadline for an\\nagreement; traders see little hope for that to be met.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0148 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0226 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2008 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220143 </ACCESN>\\n<IN> I/BAN I/BNK I/CMT </IN>\\n<GV> G/IGV G/JAGV </GV>\\n<SB> N/ART N/LAB N/LAW N/PER N/PZN N/TAX N/WTH </SB>\\n<MS> M/FIN M/TEC </MS>\\n<RE> R/ARA R/BLR R/BR R/CH R/EEU R/EU R/FE R/IO R/JA R/KU R/LTM R/ML \\n    R/NME R/PK R/PRM R/RS R/SM R/SN R/UKR R/UR R/US </RE>\\n<HL> International:  World Wire  ----  Compiled by Richard L.

He also is chairman of the Social Democratic Party, which\\nonce called for abolition of the U.S. cooperation treaty, saying it violated\\nthe constitution, which renounces war and armed forces.  \\n<p>\\n   The prime minister also characterized as outdated the SPD\\'s basic tenet of\\n\"unarmed neutrality\" as a policy for Japan.  \\n<p>\\n   A day earlier, in a major policy shift for the SDP, Mr. Murayama proclaimed\\nthat he no longer viewed Japan\\'s self-defense forces as unconstitutional. The\\nSDP Thursday decided to redraft its basic policies prior to a party convention\\nSept. 3.  \\n<p>\\n   Aiming to become a regional hub for the arts and media with more\\nwhite-collar culture jobs, Singapore unveiled plans to build a performing-arts\\ncenter. The first phase is to cost $298 million, funded by gambling revenue,\\nand be completed in the year 2000. Copying the formula it used to help build\\nthriving shipping, tourism and banking industries, the city-state specified\\nquality construction for the arts project, for which it will provide trained\\nworkers. Singapore also is building an art museum and a cable-TV system, and\\njust launched a public global-computer network.  \\n<p>\\n   Brazil\\'s tax chief offered his resignation, a casualty of the euphoria from\\nthe country\\'s fourth World Cup soccer title. Osires Lopes Filho, the Internal\\nRevenue Service secretary, clashed with aides to President Itamar Franco over\\nthe failure of the national soccer team to pay almost $1 million of customs\\nduties in returning from the U.S. Mr. Lopes said his authority was undercut by\\nthe aides who ordered customs inspections and duties waived on several tons of\\nequipment and personal items that squad members bought, including computers,\\nprinters, television sets, refrigerators, a saddle and a portable barbecue.  \\n<p>\\n   China launched a telecommunications satellite, owned by a Chinese-controlled\\ninternational consortium, APT Satellite Co. The Hong Kong consortium has\\ncontracts for the Apstar-1 satellite, with 24 transponders, to carry television\\nsignals for Western media giants, opening coveted access to Asia\\'s huge and\\ngrowing broadcast market. China rejected Japan\\'s request to alter Apstar\\'s\\nplanned orbit, which the Japanese government said could interfere with a\\nradio-relay satellite that serves remote Japanese areas. China defied a United\\nNations pact that requires consent for such nearby orbits.  \\n<p>\\n   A Jakarta court handed down the first sentence in a multimillion-dollar\\nfraud case involving an Indonesian state-owned bank. Maman Suparman,\\n48-year-old former manager of P.T. Bank Pembangunan Indonesia, known as\\nBapindo, is to serve nine years in prison. He was found guilty of corruption\\nand bribery. The state prosecutor also demanded life imprisonment for Eddy\\nTanzil, 40, a Chinese businessman to whom Bapindo lent $430 million that wasn\\'t\\nused as designated for a petrochemical project, causing a $650 million loss.\\nOther trials in the case are pending.  \\n<p>\\n   In a blow to Muslim fundamentalists, Kuwait\\'s emir denied a parliamentary\\nrequest to amend the constitution to make Islam the sole rather than primary\\nsource of legislation, newspapers in the emirate reported. The government said\\nthe emir favors implementing Islamic law, or Sharia, but only after weighing\\nresults of further study by a special group he set up. The proposal to turn the\\noil-rich emirate into an Islamic state was backed by 39 of the 50 Parliament\\nmembers. The request may be resubmitted to the emir in a year.  \\n<p>\\n   A bill to begin the second phase of Russian privatization was rejected again\\nby the State Duma, Parliament\\'s lower house. The proposal calls for selling\\nshares of former state enterprises.  \\n<p>\\n   With a majority of 226 votes needed for passage, the vote was 212-74 in\\nfavor. Last week, the legislation failed by a 186-91 tally and was sent to a\\nlegislative and government panel to reconcile differences.  \\n<p>\\n   The group\\'s revised bill included several amendments: Restrictions on\\nselling privatized land couldn\\'t be lifted until a property code is adopted.\\nHealth and education firms couldn\\'t be sold off until regulations for those\\nsectors are in place.

Financial analysts predict the bank, which has more than 28\\nbillion ringgit ($10.8 billion) in assets, will fetch about two billion ringgit\\nfor the government.  \\n<p>\\n   Finance Minister Datuk Anwar Ibrahim in April disclosed Kuala Lumpur\\'s\\nintention to put Bank Bumiputra on the block. So far, no formal bids have been\\nmade for the bank, which is currently owned by Minister of Finance Inc., a\\nstate investment holding company. Earlier this month, Datuk Anwar said the\\ngovernment hadn\\'t yet decided whether to privatize the bank completely or to\\nsell only a portion of its equity.  \\n<p>\\n   Bankers say, however, that several Malaysian corporate groups or individuals\\nhave expressed interest in acquiring the big bank, which is slowly recovering\\nfrom a series of financial scandals in the 1980s that twice wiped out Bank\\nBumiputra\\'s capital.  \\n<p>\\n   Preliminary contenders to buy the bank include fast-growing Malaysian\\nResources Corp.; Datuk Ahmad Sebi Bakar, executive chairman of Advance Synergy\\nBhd.; and Datuk Shamsudin Abu Hassan, chairman of Landmarks Bhd.  \\n<p>\\n   Other Malaysian groups looking to create diversified financial companies are\\nalso possible bidders. For example, a bank acquisition is on the agenda for a\\nteam of investors seeking to privatize state-controlled financial-services\\ngroup Kompleks Kewangan Malaysia Bhd. through a management buyout. Some\\nsecurities analysts say their target is Bank Bumiputra.  \\n<p>\\n   Another aggressive executive looking for a bank purchase, according to\\nanalysts, is Datuk Yahaya Ahmad, whose Gadek (Malaysia) Bhd. earlier this year\\nacquired control of finance company Credit Corp.

Rose  Staff Reporter of The Wall \\n    Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   Caterpillar Inc. reported record second-quarter earnings and said it expects\\nthe current national strike by the United Auto Workers union to have \"minimal\\nimpact\" on its full-year sales and profit.  \\n<p>\\n   The maker of construction equipment and diesel engines, based in Peoria,\\nIll., said that even if the month-old strike continues, savings from not paying\\nstriking workers means there will be \"little, if any, impact on third-quarter\\nprofit.\"  \\n<p>\\n   James Owens, chief financial officer, said a continued strike could shift\\nsome sales to the final quarter from the current period. But the company\\nexpects to return to production levels planned before the strike by the end of\\nSeptember, using a combination of nonunion and new workers.  \\n<p>\\n   Caterpillar said strong demand in the Americas and Asia, plus improving\\nsales elsewhere, boosted second-quarter earnings to $240 million, or $2.36 a\\nshare, from $67 million, or 66 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue jumped\\n24% to $3.61 billion from $2.91 billion a year earlier. The strike, which began\\nat facilities in Illinois, Pennsylvania and Colorado on June 21, started too\\nlate in the quarter to have a significant impact on the results.  \\n<p>\\n   The company\\'s projections of little impact from a continued strike could\\nspell bad news for the UAW. Local union leaders and many members had thought\\nthat by striking during a time of strong demand, they could pressure the\\ncompany to resolve the long string of unfair labor practice complaints against\\nit, and then could negotiate a contract to replace one that expired in 1991.  \\n<p>\\n   Instead, the projections indicate that the UAW strikers are likely to suffer\\nfar more than the company if the strike continues. While the strikers have a\\nreprieve this month in the form of two weeks of previously earned vacation pay,\\nthey will soon be back to their $100 weekly strike benefits.  \\n<p>\\n   The UAW insisted yesterday that the company is suffering too. The record\\nsecond quarter \"means the company needs its skilled and experienced work force\\nnow more than ever,\" said UAW SecretaryTreasurer Bill Casstevens in a\\nstatement. The strike \"is having and will continue to have a dramatic impact on\\nproduction,\" he contended.  \\n<p>\\n   Caterpillar maintains that its customers\\' needs are being met, but that\\ndoesn\\'t mean production is normal. Mr. Owens, the chief financial officer, said\\nin an interview that production of various models at the struck plants now\\nranges from 50% to 100%. But the company says it\\'s also filling in the gaps\\nwith machines from non-UAW factories in the U.S., Europe and Japan.  \\n<p>\\n   Caterpillar is seeking to keep its factories running with a combination of\\nmanagement and salaried workers, UAW members who have crossed the picket lines,\\nand retirees called back to work. Although Caterpillar representatives have\\ndenied it in the past, the company acknowledged yesterday that it\\'s also using\\ntemporary and contract workers at the struck factories.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Owens said more than 500 permanent new factory workers have been hired\\nsince the strike, though many would have been hired anyway. In addition, he\\nsaid 1,000 temporary workers will be on the payroll by the beginning of August,\\nincluding retirees and contract workers.  \\n<p>\\n   Caterpillar said 3,300 of the 13,400 UAW members at the eight struck\\nfacilities are regularly crossing the picket lines, but the union dismisses the\\nnumber as far too high.  \\n<p>\\n   Caterpillar shares were down $1.25 to $106.375 in late New York Stock\\nExchange composite trading yesterday, but that reflected interest rate worries\\nplaguing makers of capital goods. Indeed, analysts who had cut their earnings\\nestimates because of the strike were reconsidering yesterday.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0154 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0226 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2246 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220149 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> CSN </CO>\\n<IN> I/RTL I/TLS </IN>\\n<SB> N/ERN N/WEI </SB>\\n<MS> M/UTI </MS>\\n<RE> R/NME R/OH R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Cincinnati Bell Profit Jumps 39% </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   CINCINNATI -- Cincinnati Bell Inc. reported a 39% jump in second-quarter net\\nincome, reflecting improved results in its information-management and\\nmarketing-service business.  \\n<p>\\n   The local telephone company said net income was $18.7 million, or 28 cents a\\nshare, up from $13.5 million, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier.

Derivatives are financial agreements whose returns are linked to,\\nor derived from, the performance of some underlying asset, in this case,\\nforeign currency.  \\n<p>\\n   The actual size of the bet is a story in itself: The company\\'s quarterly\\nForm 10-Q filed in June describes the options as giving it the right to sell\\n47.52 billion yen, or $475 million -- an astounding number considering that\\nTiffany\\'s Japan sales are only about $140 million annually and its assets there\\nare said to be $60 million. (Tiffany won\\'t confirm the asset figure.)  \\n<p>\\n   But yesterday, when Tiffany was asked about the apparently huge bet, the\\ncompany backpedaled furiously on its size -- blaming \"a typo\" in the SEC\\nfiling.  \\n<p>\\n   \"There is an extra zero. We\\'re going to correct it,\" said James N.\\nFernandez, chief financial officer. Which means that Tiffany now will report to\\nthe SEC that the correct figure for the yen-put options is about 4.75 billion\\nyen, or $47.5 million.  \\n<p>\\n   Taking Tiffany at its word, the company\\'s yen position is still significant\\n-- for no other reason than that it exists at all. While many other\\ncorporations are pulling back from derivatives after a series of highly\\npublicized losses, Tiffany disclosed that it initiated a \"foreign-currency\\nhedging program\" early this year and will \"from time to time enter into\\nforeign-currency purchased put options and forward exchange contracts.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Tiffany said it needs a hedge against currency fluctuations in Japan, its\\nbiggest overseas market and one in which it plans to expand. This isn\\'t a\\nspeculative bet, Tiffany emphasizes, although at its originally reported size\\nTiffany couldn\\'t have credibly made such an argument. \"Please understand it was\\na typo; we wouldn\\'t want people to think we have $475 million in hedges,\" Mr.\\nFernandez says. He declined to disclose the amount of the current position, but\\nsaid it remains \"roughly the same\" as the level that was meant to be disclosed\\nin the SEC filing (that is, $47.5 million).  \\n<p>\\n   Whatever its size or purpose, the bet has gone the wrong way: The yen has\\nrisen 12% against the dollar so far this year, to hover around a post-World War\\nII high. Of course, things could swing the other way before next March, when\\nthe last of Tiffany\\'s options expire.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Fernandez says it doesn\\'t matter whether the options position isn\\'t\\nprofitable as a stand-alone investment. \"The program is achieving what it is\\nintended to achieve. It\\'s protecting us from a weakening yen,\" he says.\\nAlthough a strong yen hurts the options, he adds, it benefits Tiffany\\'s\\nfinancial performance in other ways.  \\n<p>\\n   Why start hedging now? Tiffany points to the reconfigured nature of its\\nJapan operations, in which the company now is responsible for millions of\\ndollars in inventory that it previously sold wholesale to department-store\\nchain Mitsukoshi. In mid-1993, Tiffany took over the marketing and\\nmerchandising of its products at 29 Japan-based Tiffany boutiques that\\nMitsukoshi had operated. To complete this \"realignment,\" Tiffany agreed to buy\\n$115 million in merchandise that it had sold to Mitsukoshi, causing a one-time\\nwrite-off of $32.7 million that contributed to the company\\'s $10.2 million net\\nloss for last year.  \\n<p>\\n   As of April 30, about $30 million of merchandise remained to be bought back\\nfrom Mitsukoshi, according to the SEC filing. Tiffany said in the filing that\\nit doesn\\'t anticipate another write-off.  \\n<p>\\n   Typo aside, these disclosures won\\'t boost investors\\' confidence in Tiffany\\'s\\nthinly traded stock on the Big Board. The shares are up 18% this year as of\\nyesterday\\'s close of 37 1/2, but they still haven\\'t fully recovered from their\\n8% decline in 1993 and the 24% tumble in 1992. At 20 times projected earnings\\nand three times book value, the stock isn\\'t cheap.  \\n<p>\\n   Analysts worry about the strength of the Japanese jewelry market of which\\nTiffany is so enamored. Of 15 analysts following Tiffany, five have \"buy\"\\nratings and 10 are neutral, according to Zacks Investment Research. In its SEC\\nfiling, Tiffany concedes that \"weak economic conditions and cautious consumer\\nspending are continuing to affect the company\\'s sales in Japan and Europe.\"\\nThat is no typo.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0156 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0227 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 1901 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220151 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> DE TXT </CO>\\n<IN> I/CGL I/MAC </IN>\\n<SB> N/ERN N/TNM </SB>\\n<MS> M/CGL M/IDU </MS>\\n<RE> R/IL R/NME R/RI R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Textron Earnings  Increased 17%  In Second Quarter  ----  By William \\n    M. Bulkeley  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Textron Inc. continued its 19-quarter string of improved\\nquarterly results and said it will sell its Homelite outdoor tools line to\\nDeere & Co. for about $120 million.  \\n<p>\\n   Textron reported second-quarter net income rose 17% to $110 million, or\\n$1.22 a share, from $94 million, or $1.05 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose\\n12% to $2.52 billion from $2.25 billion.  \\n<p>\\n   The sale of Homelite continues Textron\\'s pattern of moving away from\\nconsumer products and underperforming businesses and concentrating on\\nindustrial products, auto parts and aircraft as well as insurance and finance. \\n\\n<p>\\n   Homelite makes chain saws, string trimmers, leaf blowers and brush cutters.\\nDeere, based in Moline, Ill., primarily a maker of farm and construction\\nequipment, said Homelite will be \"an important addition to our lawn and\\ngrounds-care equipment division.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Homelite had revenue last year of $246 million and was profitable, a Textron\\nspokesman said. However, it has lost money in some past years and it isn\\'t a\\nmarket leader. \"It\\'s a good business if you\\'re No. 1 or No. 2, and that\\'s why\\nit makes sense for Deere,\" said one Textron official.  \\n<p>\\n   The Homelite transaction \"gives our lawn and grounds-care operations another\\nwell-established brand name, and it extends our reach for the first time into\\nthe mass-merchandising channels,\" said a Deere spokesman. The company\\'s current\\nproducts are typically sold through dealers.  \\n<p>\\n   Proceeds of the sale will be used to pare down debt and repurchase stock.  \\n<p>\\n   Textron said its revenue and earnings improved in all sectors except the\\nsystems and components division that includes Textron Lycoming. As previously\\nannounced, Lycoming will be sold to AlliedSignal Inc., Morristown, N.J., for\\n$375 million.  \\n<p>\\n   The aircraft business, including Cessna business jets and Bell helicopters,\\nsaw a 30% pretax increase in operating profit on a 13% revenue gain.

Grossman  Staff Reporter \\n    of The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   ATLANTA-Coca -- Cola Co. appeared to firm up its succession plan, naming M.\\nDouglas Ivester as president just three months after the company indefinitely\\nextended the tenure of its chief executive.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Ivester, 47 years old, was promoted to the posts of president and chief\\noperating officer, virtually ending concerns that Coke hadn\\'t designated a\\nsuccessor to Roberto C. Goizueta, 62, chairman and chief executive. In April,\\nthe company said Mr. Goizueta would stay on as chief executive for \"an\\nindefinite period\" after he reaches age 65 in 1996. In an interview yesterday ,\\nMr. Goizueta said those plans haven\\'t changed.  \\n<p>\\n   The company also promoted a highly regarded younger executive. Jack Stahl,\\nthe 41-year-old chief financial officer, was named president of Coca-Cola USA,\\na move that will give him most of the responsibility Mr. Ivester had as\\nexecutive vice president and principal operating officer/North America. Mr.\\nStahl will be succeeded by James Chestnut, 44, who had been vice president and\\ncontroller.  \\n<p>\\n   Analysts and industry officials said Mr. Ivester\\'s appointment seems to\\nanoint him as successor to Mr. Goizueta and confirms the company\\'s faith in Mr.\\nIvester, who has also served as chief financial officer and head of Coke\\'s\\nEuropean and U.S. operations.  \\n<p>\\n   \"Ivester is a good no-nonsense leader,\" said Michael Bellas, an industry\\nconsultant. \"It certainly puts him in a good spot for the top job, although\\nthere are no guarantees.\"  \\n<p>\\n   However, Mr. Goizueta continued to hedge his bets regarding succession. \"It\\ndoes not mean that Mr. Ivester is my successor,\" he said. \"I have no idea who\\nthe right person will be for my job whenever I retire.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Ivester must develop a broad strategy to guide the company beyond its\\naggressive development of overseas markets, said Roy Burry, an analyst at\\nKidder Peabody. Coke, which derives 80% of its income from overseas, has seen\\nbig profit centers such as Japan post slowing sales volume in recent quarters;\\nanalysts say those developments have hurt Coke\\'s stock, despite the potential\\nin less-developed markets.  \\n<p>\\n   \"Emerging markets will drive the company\\'s earnings for the next decade, and\\nGoizueta is responsible for that,\" Mr. Burry said. \"Ivester must implement the\\nstrategy for the next century.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Coke hasn\\'t had a president since Donald R. Keough retired in April 1993.\\nMany industry officials had said a replacement with Mr. Keough\\'s diplomatic\\nskills wasn\\'t to be found among Coke\\'s top ranks, which slowed down the\\nsuccession process.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Goizueta said Mr. Ivester was too busy reinvigorating the company\\'s\\nmarketing to assume the top operations post when Mr. Keough retired.  \\n<p>\\n   \"He couldn\\'t be chief operating officer and devote the time it took to\\nreconfigure and re-energize our marketing efforts world-wide,\" Mr. Goizueta\\nsaid.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0158 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0227 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2218 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220153 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> U </CO>\\n<IN> I/AIR </IN>\\n<SB> N/HIY N/LAB N/TNM </SB>\\n<MS> M/CYC </MS>\\n<RE> R/NME R/US R/VA </RE>\\n<HL> USAir\\'s Pilots  Propose Equity  For Concessions  ---  Machinists \\n    and Attendants  Invited to Join Effort  To Help Ailing Carrier  \\n    ----  By Carl Quintanilla  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   USAir Group Inc.\\'s pilots\\' union, responding to the struggling airline\\'s\\ncall for $500 million in labor concessions, said it will recommend to other\\nunions that they jointly seek an equity stake and board representation in\\nreturn for givebacks.  \\n<p>\\n   The Air Line Pilots Association, working with two other unions at USAir, is\\nleading the employee response to the carrier\\'s proposal to cut $1 billion a\\nyear from its expenses by 1997. The pilots, meeting yesterday in Reston, Va.,\\nwouldn\\'t say how large a stake they will propose seeking or how they will\\npropose dividing the stake among the pilots\\', machinists\\' and flight\\nattendants\\' unions. But they did say they wouldn\\'t seek majority ownership.\\n\"The key issue is we\\'re trying to make ourselves more competitive,\" said one\\npilot union official.  \\n<p>\\n   USAir\\'s unions had been expected to seek some sort of equity stake in return\\nfor concessions. UAL Corp.\\'s employees just received a 55% stake in the parent\\nof United Airlines in return for pay cuts and work-rule changes. And Trans\\nWorld Airlines and Northwest Airlines underwent similar restructurings that put\\nlarge minority stakes in workers\\' hands.  \\n<p>\\n   But for USAir, which has one of the highest cost structures in the industry,\\nthe need for lower labor costs is particularly dire. The Arlington, Va.-based\\ncarrier, the nation\\'s sixth-largest airline, is facing new and brutal\\ncompetition from low-cost rivals invading its East Coast markets. While its\\nsecond-quarter net income, announced earlier this week, surpassed expectations,\\nUSAir still is predicting a loss for all of 1994, which would be its sixth\\nconsecutive annual loss.  \\n<p>\\n   USAir did talk its unions into wage and work-rule concessions in 1992,\\nsaving about $170 million in wages. But the wage cuts were effective for only\\n12 months and pay has reverted to prior levels, leaving unions unwilling to\\ntake further pay cuts without something tangible in return.  \\n<p>\\n   Moreover, pilots say they\\'re interested in having a larger say in the\\nmanagement of the company this time around, and therefore will seek seats on\\nthe board. \"In the past, the attitude has been `management manages and labor\\nlabors,\\'\" said an ALPA official. \"We\\'re not looking at it that way anymore.\"  \\n<p>\\n   USAir earlier this year sharply cut its fares in order to match its\\ncompetition. It has since postponed deliveries of 40 Boeing Co. jets,\\nrestructured some of its finances and subcontracted out some nonunion jobs.\\nThese days, it is working on a program to reduce the ground time of its\\naircraft in many cities.  \\n<p>\\n   A spokesman for USAir said he hadn\\'t heard of any labor action being\\nconsidered, and couldn\\'t comment on ALPA\\'s plan.  \\n<p>\\n   Once the pilots finalize a proposal this weekend, they are expected to join\\nwith the flight attendants\\' and machinists\\' unions, and approach the company as\\na labor coalition.  \\n<p>\\n   \"We\\'re very interested in seeing what ALPA has come up with,\" said Carol\\nAustin, president of the Association of Flight Attendants at USAir. \"We\\'re\\npoised and ready to invest in the company, but only on a fair and equitable\\nbasis.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Officials of the machinists\\' union didn\\'t return telephone calls.  \\n<p>\\n   This week, USAir surprised Wall Street by reporting improved second-quarter\\nnet earnings of $13.8 million, up from $5.8 million a year ago. However, the\\ncompany recorded a per-share loss of nine cents after paying preferred\\ndividends of $19.3 million.

In the year-earlier\\nquarter, MGM Grand had a loss of $2.1 million, or four cents a share. The\\ncompany attributed the gains to stronger operating margins at its new\\nhotel-casino and theme park here, which opened last December.  \\n<p>\\n   Revenue in the quarter soared to $192.2 million, from $4.7 million a year\\nago, when the company\\'s big MGM Grand property on the Las Vegas Strip wasn\\'t\\nyet open. Hotel occupancy there was 97% for the quarter, while the average room\\nrate was $82, the company said. The quarterly results exceeded most analysts\\'\\nexpectations of about 34 cents a share.  \\n<p>\\n   Alex Yemenidjian, executive vice president, said slot and table-game play\\nremain strong. To boost attendance at its theme park, the company is no longer\\ncharging an admission fee at the front gate; instead, it allows visitors in for\\nfree and sells them wristbands that admit them to shows and rides. The\\ncompany\\'s cost controls have helped boost operating margins to about 25%, Mr.\\nYemenidjian said.  \\n<p>\\n   MGM Grand\\'s stock closed at $25.875 a share, unchanged, in New York Stock\\nExchange composite trading yesterday.  \\n<p>\\n   Separately, company executives said they are studying three domestic sites\\nand three international sites for possible new projects. All are in major\\ntravel-destination markets or areas that are developing into such markets, Mr.\\nYemenidjian said. One site is the company\\'s 18-acre parcel in Las Vegas across\\nthe street from its hotelcasino and theme park. Mr. Yemenidjian said the\\ncompany isn\\'t looking to invest in riverboat-casino markets at this point.  \\n<p>\\n   Jason Ader, an analyst with Smith Barney, said he expects the company to\\ncontinue cutting expenses and improving margins, and to announce at least one\\nnew project soon.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0160 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0227 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2120 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220155 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> CCBT </CO>\\n<IN> I/BAE I/BAR I/BNK </IN>\\n<SB> N/DIV </SB>\\n<MS> M/FIN </MS>\\n<RE> R/MA R/NME R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Dividend News:  Cape Cod Bank & Trust Co. </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   CAPE COD BANK & TRUST Co., Hyannis, Mass., declared a 15-cent quarterly\\ndividend, payable Aug. 5 to shareholders of record Aug. 1.

Hudson  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street \\n    Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   LONDON -- Why does Europe\\'s personal-computer-software industry fare so\\npoorly in the world market?  \\n<p>\\n   That\\'s the uncomfortable question being asked by many in the industry,\\nfollowing a controversial settlement among U.S. software giant Microsoft Corp.\\nand U.S. and European antitrust regulators. In both the U.S. and Europe,\\nMicrosoft rivals complained that the accord, announced Saturday, won\\'t clip the\\nwings of the industry\\'s dominant player. But in Europe, the issue is almost\\nacademic: Even if the regulators had been tougher on Microsoft, there isn\\'t\\nmuch of a local PC-software industry to care.  \\n<p>\\n   \"There\\'s only a handful\" of significant European PC-software houses, says\\nMarco Boerries, president of Star Division GmbH, the second-biggest publisher\\nof word-processing software in Germany, after No. 1 Microsoft. He and others\\nblame lots of factors for the European weakness: a late start, a market\\nfragmented by different languages, insufficient venture capital and hardball\\ntactics by Microsoft and other big U.S. software houses.  \\n<p>\\n   \"The American software vendors are slowly but surely strangling the European\\nmarket,\" says Roger Fulton, a London software-industry analyst for Input\\nEurope, a market-research company.  \\n<p>\\n   The numbers are striking. U.S. software houses last year sold $1.82 billion\\nof PC-software packages in Europe -- more than three-quarters of the market,\\naccording to the Software Publishers Association, a trade group of U.S.\\npublishers. Of the Top 10 PC-software houses operating in Europe, nine are\\nAmerican and one is Canadian, according to market-research company Dataquest\\nInc. The biggest, Microsoft, had 31.8% of the market for PC applications-word\\nprocessors, spreadsheets, graphics programs, and the like. Lotus Development\\nCorp., based in Cambridge, Mass., came in second with a 15.6% share.  \\n<p>\\n   To be sure, Europe has some heavyweight software houses, but most shun the\\nPC market as too cutthroat. Instead, such big firms as France\\'s Cap Gemini\\nSogeti SA and Germany\\'s SAP AG continue to get most of their revenue from\\ncostly, complex programs written for mainframe computers or big\\ncorporate-computer networks.  \\n<p>\\n   More typical of European PC-software houses are small companies like\\nBritain\\'s Sage Systems Ltd., or Germany\\'s Star Division and KHK Software\\nGmbH-all specialized players that stay close to home. They thrive in market\\nniches that, until recently, the big U.S. software houses had ignored, such as\\nbusiness-accounting software tailored to each country\\'s language and tax\\npeculiarities.  \\n<p>\\n   And few contemplate expanding far beyond their home markets. \"It wouldn\\'t be\\nprofitable to sell an accounting product out of Germany into France,\" says a\\nspokesman for Germany\\'s KHK. \"In France a good range of financial software is\\nalready available,\" he adds.  \\n<p>\\n   In analyzing their weaknesses, European-industry officials identify two\\ntypes of problems: Those they blame on inefficiencies in Europe, and those they\\npin on their U.S. rivals.  \\n<p>\\n   The Microsoft case highlighted the anti-U.S. complaints. On Saturday, the\\nU.S. Justice Department and the European Union Commission announced\\nsimultaneous settlements of their long-running antitrust probes of Microsoft.\\nOn both continents, the allegations were nearly identical: that Microsoft used\\nanticompetitive software-licensing and marketing practices to dominate the\\nmarkets.  \\n<p>\\n   As reported, the near-identical EU and U.S. settlements require Microsoft to\\nend a few of its disputed practices, such as making PC makers pay it a fee for\\nevery PC they sell -- regardless of whether that particular PC was actually\\nshipped with Microsoft software.  \\n<p>\\n   But many European software officials contacted Monday berated the EU\\nCommission for letting Microsoft off easy on the main issue: its alleged\\npractice of using inside knowledge of its MS-DOS and Windows operating systems\\nto give it a leg up in the market for applications software that uses them. An\\noperating system is a PC\\'s most-elemental software that controls how other,\\nso-called applications programs such as word processors or spreadsheets, will\\nbe executed.  \\n<p>\\n   \"The real problem is the unfair practices which are happening inside\\nMicrosoft,\" rather than its licensing terms to outsiders, complains Star\\nDivision\\'s Mr. Boerries. With a grip on both parts of the market, \"they really\\nhave everything tied up.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Microsoft officials deny such claims. \"We\\'ve bent backwards to let people\\nunderstand what we do in operating systems long before we cast plans,\" says\\nBernard Vergnes, president of Microsoft-Europe. The proof of its innocence, he\\nsays, is that the EU and Justice Department settlements stuck to some specific\\nlicensing issues.  \\n<p>\\n   Following the settlements, Mr. Vergnes says, \"competitors can still be\\nfrustrated at the size of Microsoft, and at the fact that those antitrust\\njudgments don\\'t change the face of the world. And they might still believe\\nMicrosoft should be destroyed -- that is their privilege. What can I say? We\\nare more open as a company than we have ever been before.\"  \\n<p>\\n   But while attacking Microsoft, most European industry executives acknowledge\\nsome of their problems start right at home.  \\n<p>\\n   To start with, many say, in PC-software as in other fields most European\\ncountries lack the abundant venture capital that got Microsoft, Lotus and other\\nU.S. companies off the ground.  \\n<p>\\n   Then too, the PC industry was born in the U.S. -- and European companies\\nwere tardy in forming global ambitions to make PCs or write software for them. \\n\\n<p>\\n   And as most new ideas in PCs continue to come from California\\'s Silicon\\nValley, European companies are forever behind in getting the latest, inside\\ntechnical information about where the industry majors are headed. Bigger\\nEuropean companies, such as Star Division, now have Silicon Valley offices to\\nget the latest insights, but that\\'s a luxury most European startups can\\'t\\nafford.  \\n<p>\\n   But perhaps the biggest problem, many say, is geographic. Unlike the U.S.\\nmarket, where the same word-processing or accounting program can be sold across\\nthe continent, in Europe different languages, tax systems and business cultures\\nfragment the market. That makes it tough for a German or French company to get\\nAmerican-style economies of scale, says Hannes Keller, founder of Hannes Keller\\nWitch Systems AG, a small Zurich-based PC-software house.  \\n<p>\\n   One of Mr. Keller\\'s programs, a socalled utility package that performs some\\nhousekeeping tasks for Windows, is a bestseller in Germany. But even so, he\\nsays, it doesn\\'t generate enough sales to pay for Germany-wide newspaper\\nadvertising -- an important marketing tool that archrival Microsoft can easily\\nafford in Germany because of its world-wide economies of scale. What\\'s worse,\\nas software prices fall, such economies of scale grow more important and the\\nhandicaps to small European companies swell.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Keller likens his industry\\'s problem to that of a European pop singer\\ntrying to get noticed over the world-wide din of the American Top 40 tunes. In\\nEurope, he says, \"there are an abundance of girls who sing, who look beautiful\\nand who want to make a career -- but how can they make the world know that\\nthey\\'re there and have wonderful voices?\"  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0163 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0228 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 1915 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220158 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> MGR </CO>\\n<IN> I/RTS I/SAP </IN>\\n<SB> N/BCY N/HIY N/PER </SB>\\n<MS> M/CYC </MS>\\n<RE> R/MD R/NME R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Who\\'s News:  Merry-Go-Round Enterprises Inc. </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   MERRY-GO-ROUND ENTERPRISES Inc.

The money raised will match loans to projects in the region.  \\n<p>\\n   \"We think this is a breakthrough,\" said Louis de Montpellier, director,\\nfunding, for the bank. \"It answers needs of Eastern clients with local-currency\\nrevenue. And it will allow us to have a positive influence on the development\\nof local capital markets, which we think is key to the transition of these\\neconomies to full-fledged market economies.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Bonds and equity denominated in local currencies are essential for each\\ncountry\\'s own bond and stock markets to work. Several countries do have local\\nstock markets, and increasing numbers of Eastern entities have issued debt in\\ntheir local currency.  \\n<p>\\n   The one billion Hungarian forints ($10 million) to be raised through the\\nfirst chunk of EBRD bonds sold will finance a motorway under construction\\nbetween Budapest and Vienna, said Mr. de Montpellier. The EBRD must match money\\nraised in forints with money lent because the currency isn\\'t fully convertible\\nand can\\'t be hedged.  \\n<p>\\n   \"Normally, our funding strategy is completely independent from our\\ninvestment strategy,\" said Mr. de Montpellier. Thus far, the bank has raised\\nmoney for its activities in 12 convertible currencies, including the Hong Kong\\ndollar and Greek drachma.  \\n<p>\\n   In all, the EBRD hopes to issue five billion forints of bonds in Hungary, or\\nabout $50 million worth at current exchange rates.  \\n<p>\\n   The Hungarian subsidiary of Daiwa Securities, the Japanese investment bank,\\nis the lead manager of the issue.

Castle to Report  Second-Quarter Profit  More Than Doubled </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   FRANKLIN PARK, Ill. -- Riding increased demand for steel products by makers\\nof capital goods, A.M. Castle & Co. said it expects to report next week that\\nearnings more than doubled for the second quarter in a row.  \\n<p>\\n   Michael Simpson, chairman of the distributor of specialty metals, said that\\nCastle expects to report next Thursday that second-quarter earnings rose to\\nbetween $3.3 million and $3.4 million, or 44 cents to 45 cents a share. In last\\nyear\\'s second quarter, Castle earned $1.6 million, or 22 cents a share.  \\n<p>\\n   The company also expects to report continued gains in sales, though at a\\nslower pace than the 12% advance in this year\\'s first quarter. Mr. Simpson said\\nsales in the latest quarter rose between 8% and 9% to a range of $131 million\\nto $132 million, from $121 million a year earlier.  \\n<p>\\n   In the first quarter, Castle reported earnings of $3.6 million, or 50 cents\\na share, compared with $1.8 million, or 24 cents a share, in the 1993 period.  \\n<p>\\n   \"The interest rate nudges had the desired effect,\" Mr. Simpson said,\\nreferring to recent interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve. He said\\nthat by slowing earlier robust growth, the interest rate increases mean there\\'s\\na potential for extending growth \"for a much longer period of time.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Simpson said he sees that economic growth continuing through 1995, and\\nthat if that occurs, Castle \"should have the same potential.\" For the rest of\\nthis year, the company projects \"favorable\" quarterly comparisons, but at lower\\nrates of growth than in this year\\'s first two quarters.  \\n<p>\\n   One of the factors that makes Mr. Simpson optimistic through next year is\\nhis expectation that Castle\\'s customers will be able to export more goods to\\nEurope as nations there recover from economic slowdowns.  \\n<p>\\n   At the same time, he said Castle is benefiting at home from still-strong\\nsales of capital goods, and from cost controls and gains in market share. As\\nlarge customers continue to pare their number of suppliers, \"the opportunity to\\ngain market share is tremendous,\" Mr. Simpson said.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0168 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0228 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2006 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220163 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> J.JAP JAPNY </CO>\\n<IN> I/AIR </IN>\\n<SB> N/MRK N/TVL </SB>\\n<MS> M/CYC </MS>\\n<RE> R/EU R/FE R/FR R/GE R/ITA R/JA R/PRM R/UK R/WEU </RE>\\n<HL> Japan Air Cuts Fares  On Tickets to Europe  By Average of 43.5% </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   TOKYO -- Japan Airlines, one of the world\\'s largest airline carriers,\\nannounced that it will cut air fares on round-trip tickets to Europe for a\\nsix-month period beginning Oct. 1, a spokesman said.  \\n<p>\\n   The airline will reduce fares by an average of 43.5%, the spokesman said.

Many times, when suggesting\\neven the most modest of fiscal restraint, I\\'ve heard the stinging retort, \"What\\ndo you care, it\\'s not your money.\" At one time or another, I heard this from\\nall camps: patients and families; physicians; adjudicators; labor groups;\\nemployers; hospital representatives.  \\n<p>\\n   Health care cost drivers are many and complex. The most noble citizen\\ncherishes his/her money more the OPM (other people\\'s money). The business\\nsector sees empowerment, organizational flattening and front line\\naccountability as essential to survival. Isn\\'t the Medisave Account proposal of\\nPete du Pont (\"The Free-Market Health Proposal,\" editorial page, July 1) and\\nothers exactly this?  \\n<p>\\n   If sufficiently easy and widespread, fiscal empowerment of the patient would\\ncause significant cost reduction. Several years ago a patient with 80/20\\nindemnity insurance asked my advice on hospital choice for her daughter\\'s\\ntonsillectomy. As I suggested, she surveyed several quality hospitals and found\\na range of $600 to $3,400. She chose the more distant, better value facility.  \\n<p>\\n   Why not try this? Justly, the fear of unforeseen negatives of major\\ntinkering seems to be tempering if not derailing health policy action. Why not\\ntinker in a minor way and take a chance on perhaps major positive effects? A\\nlittle bath water out the window, the baby remains relatively undisturbed\\ninside, and something has been done?  \\n<p>\\n   There is much good in American health care. I believe what\\'s lacking is\\npersonal accountability on all sides of the fence.  \\n<p>\\n   Is the medical savings account concept too elegant in its simplicity for the\\nstomach of American politics? If one carried it beyond retirement, making it\\npart of one\\'s estate with rational reserves based upon projected need, what\\neffect might this have on self-determination in terminal, high-cost, medically\\nfutile situations? As technology advances and those like me age, this will be\\nmore of a fiscal and personal rights conundrum.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. du Pont is misleading in his assertion that tax law \"allows conventional\\ninsurance premiums to be deducted from income\" on which taxes are paid.\\nCurrently, only medical expenses in excess of 7.5% of adjusted gross income are\\ndeductible.  \\n<p>\\n   The government\\'s limitation on medical deductions was introduced in 1954 and\\nhas led to a dependence on employers (which are not subject to the limitation)\\nfor the provision of health care. This has resulted in Mr. du Pont\\'s\\n\"bureaucrat working for the government or a clerk working for an insurer making\\nthe ultimate decisions on whether a dollar should be spent on health care or\\nsomething else.\" This curious tax provision marked the end of the good old days\\nof house calls by doctors who accepted payment only when a patient could afford\\nit, and ushered in an era of spiraling costs for which no one was held\\naccountable.  \\n<p>\\n   The \"medical savings accounts\" advocated by Mr. du Pont would be nice, but\\nwhat we really need is simply a system where a citizen need not suffer a tax\\npenalty in order to pay his own routine medical bills and purchase his own\\ninsurance for catastrophic events. We need to kill the ridiculous limitations\\non medical expense deductions.  \\n<p>\\n   I believe Mr. du Pont\\'s conclusion that a medical savings account (MSA)\\nsignificantly reduces medical and related administrative cost wrongly presumes:\\n(1) all employees of Golden Rule Insurance Co. have claims of $2,500 or more\\neach year and (2) all medical expense up to $2,500 automatically qualifies for\\npayment from the MSA. In reality, probably only half of the employees have a\\nmedical claim in a given year, and MSA payments would have to be consistent\\nwith the health insurance plan design. Giving $2,500 to all employees,\\nincluding those who will have no claim, effectively increases the average\\nmedical plan cost per employee. And someone will still have to administer the\\nMSA payouts since the insurance company providing the catastrophe protection\\nwill surely expect an accurate accounting of the payouts before it pays claims\\nover and above the MSA limit.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0174 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0228 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2100 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220169 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> CRLN </CO>\\n<IN> I/HEA </IN>\\n<SB> N/TNM </SB>\\n<MS> M/NCY </MS>\\n<RE> R/CA R/NME R/PRM R/TX R/US </RE>\\n<HL> CareLine Purchases Life Line </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   IRVINE, Calif. -- CareLine Inc. said it completed the acquisition of Life\\nLine EMS, based in Wichita Falls, Texas.  \\n<p>\\n   Terms weren\\'t disclosed.

Wilke and William M. Bulkeley  Staff Reporters \\n    of The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   Raytheon Co. was picked by Brazil to build an environmental surveillance and\\nair-traffic control system in the Amazon region in a contract valued at more\\nthan $1 billion.  \\n<p>\\n   The award follows a series of contract wins by U.S. businesses abroad in\\nwhich senior Clinton administration officials have been involved.  \\n<p>\\n   The contract includes a network of radar ground stations, satellite imaging\\nsystems and communications centers, and also would target drug-flight\\ninterdiction, Commerce Department officials said.  \\n<p>\\n   The department valued the contract at between $1.2 billion and $1.48 billion\\nover six years, but Lexington, Mass.-based Raytheon said only that its value is\\n\"in excess of $1 billion.\" The other finalist in the bidding was Thompson SA of\\nFrance, department officials said.  \\n<p>\\n   The pact is a coup for Raytheon, which like other defense contractors is\\neager to find nonmilitary markets at a time when U.S. defense budgets are\\nshrinking. The agreement is Raytheon\\'s largest nonmilitary contract, the\\ncompany said.  \\n<p>\\n   News of the pact was released after the market closed. Raytheon stock rose\\n62.5 cents to $65.125 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.  \\n<p>\\n   The company\\'s selection came days after the end of a U.S. trade mission to\\nBrazil, Argentina and Chile. \"We landed a big one -- a great victory for\\nAmerican business and for this administration,\" said Commerce Secretary Ron\\nBrown, who led the mission.  \\n<p>\\n   Boeing Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. and AT&T Corp. have scored multibillion\\ndollar awards in recent months in bidding contests in which the administration\\nhas taken a direct role, often including personal intervention by President\\nClinton.  \\n<p>\\n   Mr. Brown said the contract \"can help save the Amazon\" by protecting\\nBrazil\\'s rain forest, which is besieged by ranchers, loggers and developers.  \\n<p>\\n   The planned Amazon Surveillance System will collect and analyze information\\nabout the Amazon basin and plan land use and economic development. It is an\\nattempt to use technology to bring control to one of the planet\\'s rawest\\nremaining frontiers.  \\n<p>\\n   Raytheon\\'s proposal involves a network of remote satellite sensing and\\nground-based and airborne sensors. It also includes air-traffic control radars,\\nweather radars, software and system management.  \\n<p>\\n   William H. Swanson, Raytheon senior vice president, said when Raytheon was\\nnamed a finalist in the competition that the project is designed to \"reduce\\ndeforestation and wildlife destruction, combat illegal mining and drug\\ntrafficking, improve population and public health controls.\" In the vast and\\nsparsely populated Amazon basin, ground-based police often aren\\'t aware of harm\\nto inhabitants and forest tracts until the damage is done. Raytheon also said\\nthe project will strengthen border security and communication.  \\n<p>\\n   Raytheon has managed to increase sales and earnings in recent years through\\ngrowth in businesses such as construction, its Beech aircraft subsidiary and\\nappliances, and through cutting costs and jobs in its defense business. Last\\nyear, Raytheon had net income of $693 million or $5.11 a share, up 9.1%. Sales\\nrose 1.6% to $9.2 billion.  \\n<p>\\n   A Raytheon official said the company expects to be under contract by the\\nthird quarter, and to book the entire project in the company\\'s backlog in the\\nfourth quarter. She declined to speculate on the revenue or profit impact in\\nthe current year. Raytheon heads a team that includes International Business\\nMachines Corp.\\'s Brazil unit and several Brazilian companies.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0178 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0229 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2004 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220173 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> R </CO>\\n<IN> I/ICS I/SVC </IN>\\n<SB> N/ERN </SB>\\n<MS> M/IDU </MS>\\n<RE> R/FL R/NME R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Ryder System Had  $49.8 Million Profit  In Second Quarter </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   MIAMI -- Ryder System Inc., bolstered by strong performances in all its\\ndivisions, reported second-quarter earnings of 64 cents a share compared with a\\nyear-earlier loss of $1.60 a share.  \\n<p>\\n   The transportation services concern said net income totaled $49.8 million in\\nthe quarter compared with a loss of $122.2 million a year earlier.

Revenue rose 9% to $1.18 billion from $1.08 billion.  \\n<p>\\n   The results, which exceeded analysts\\' expectations, reflected particular\\nstrength in Ryder\\'s commercial and consumer truck rentals and in its automotive\\ncarrier division, said M.

Shanghai is China\\'s largest city, while\\nShenzhen is an export zone adjacent to Hong Kong in southern China.  \\n<p>\\n   Investors sent the Shenzhen exchange index to a new low of 97.91 in trading\\nThursday. The Shanghai Class A share index lost 3.5%, reaching its lowest point\\nsince early 1993. The Shanghai index is 77% off its high, with most of the drop\\ncoming in the past three months.  \\n<p>\\n   Class A shares can only be bought and sold by Chinese citizens. Class B\\nshares, which can also be traded by foreign investors, are also hemorrhaging,\\nthough less dramatically, on both exchanges.  \\n<p>\\n   Only months ago, brokers and government officials spoke of Shanghai\\novertaking Hong Kong as Asia\\'s second-largest stock market, after Japan, within\\na couple of years. Many now talk of having to rebuild the market. Daily volume\\non the exchange, averaging about 250 million yuan ($28.8 million), is less than\\na fifth of the level of the market\\'s early days.  \\n<p>\\n   \"Frankly speaking, there is no one interested in buying anything,\" said Wei\\nZhi, an executive at Shanghai International Securities, China\\'s largest\\nbrokerage house. \"You can say there are bargains out there if you pick your\\nstocks carefully. But if you wait a month, the bargains will be even better.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Brokers predicted that the Shanghai index will fall by at least 5% more in\\nthe near future from 380 now to well below its record low of 362. They predict\\nShenzhen\\'s index will continue to spiral down from its historical beginning of\\n100, a level not seen in three years.  \\n<p>\\n   Meanwhile, Shanghai\\'s Class B share index fell to 66.30 Thursday, off 37% so\\nfar for the year. Shenzhen\\'s Class B share index closed at 99.76, down 30%\\nsince the year began.  \\n<p>\\n   \"There\\'s no real buying interest in B shares, even at this level,\" said\\nLawrence Ang, a Hong Kong-based China stock analyst. \"People are just waiting\\nfor price/earnings ratios to come down further.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Analysts cite a variety of factors in the market\\'s continuing plunge. Among\\nthem: A national crackdown on bank loans has squeezed company profits; the\\ngovernment\\'s fight against inflation has made it difficult for many firms to\\nraise prices; and China\\'s mostly small-scale private investors have given up on\\nthe relatively new stock markets to look for safer investment opportunities.  \\n<p>\\n   \"It used to be that investors came to our lobby in large numbers every day\\nto check the latest stock prices on our television screens,\" said a broker at\\nShanghai\\'s Shenyin Securities. \"Very few people come now.

LOUIS, Mo. -- Monsanto Co. reported its best-ever quarter, as earnings\\nclimbed 29% on a modest 1.7% increase in sales.  \\n<p>\\n   The chemical, pharmaceutical and food-additive company had second-quarter\\nnet income of $258 million, or $2.19 a share, compared with the year-earlier\\nperiod\\'s $200 million, or $1.66 a share. Sales were $2.27 billion, compared\\nwith $2.23 billion.  \\n<p>\\n   Monsanto again benefited from big earnings at its agricultural group, which\\nis powered by its flagship Roundup herbicide. Even though the year-earlier\\nperiod was bolstered by big herbicide sales linked to the Midwest\\'s extremely\\nwet spring, the agricultural group\\'s operating income inched up less than 1% to\\n$260 million, on sales that rose 1.3% to $753 million.  \\n<p>\\n   Monsanto\\'s chemical group was spurred, as it was in the first quarter, by\\nstrong demand from the North American automotive, housing and home furnishings\\nmarkets, as well as an improved economic picture in Europe and a continuing\\ncorporate cost-cutting effort. Operating income rose 37% to $103 million,\\ndespite sales that were essentially flat at $926 million.  \\n<p>\\n   The company\\'s Searle pharmaceutical unit yielded operating profit of $3\\nmillion, an improvement over the $37 million operating loss it suffered in last\\nyear\\'s quarter, when new-product introductions weighed down earnings.  \\n<p>\\n   The results topped the $2 to $2.05 a share analysts had been expecting; in\\nlate New York Stock Exchange trading, Monsanto shares were up $1, at $76.75.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0183 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0229 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 2001 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220178 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> LVC </CO>\\n<IN> I/OTS I/RTS </IN>\\n<SB> N/DIV N/MTG N/PDT </SB>\\n<MS> M/CYC </MS>\\n<RE> R/CN R/NME R/NY R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Lillian Vernon Corp.

A victim\\nof sluggish legal processes and the government\\'s propensity to change the\\nrules, the proposed linkup now stands as an example of the risks of doing\\nbusiness in India.  \\n<p>\\n   Since its inception, the merger plan has faced obstacles, including\\nchallenges from labor unions, consumer protection groups and others arguing\\nthat the deal would give Hindustan Lever -- already a market leader in soaps,\\ndetergents and personal-care products -- a dominant market share of more than\\n90% in some areas. Now, Hindustan Lever, the Indian unit of Anglo-Dutch\\nconsumer goods giant Unilever NV, has filed a suit against the Reserve Bank of\\nIndia following a change of regulations announced in June that threatens to\\ntriple Unilever\\'s share of the merger costs.  \\n<p>\\n   The case, lodged earlier this month in the Bombay High Court, arises from\\nnew guidelines on so-called preferential-share issues by units of foreign\\ncompanies. India\\'s corporate law allows companies to issue blocks of shares for\\nspecific purposes, such as enabling foreign principals to increase their stakes\\nin their Indian affiliates.  \\n<p>\\n   The planned Tata-Lever merger would lead to an increase in the share base of\\nHindustan Lever and would dilute Unilever\\'s stake in its Indian unit to 49.98%\\nfrom a controlling 51%. As a result, Hindustan Lever sought permission from the\\nReserve Bank -- which has jurisdiction over foreign companies -- for a\\npreferential-share issue aimed at restoring Unilever\\'s stake to 51%.  \\n<p>\\n   Also, in an unrelated development, Unilever sought to increase to 51% its\\nstakes in two other units, Ponds India Ltd. and Stepan Chemicals Ltd., makers\\nof personal-care products, soaps and detergents.  \\n<p>\\n   For reasons that aren\\'t clear, the central bank appears to have sat on\\nHindustan Lever\\'s application for almost seven months after it was filed in\\nNovember. Now, citing its new retroactive government guidelines on preferential\\nshare issues -- which require companies to adopt a different, more restrictive\\nshare-pricing formula -- the central bank has asked the company to apply again.\\n \\n<p>\\n   The new formula is aimed at preventing companies from issuing preferential\\nshares to foreign concerns at steeply discounted market prices of their stock,\\na situation that arose after June 1992 when controls on share pricing were\\nabolished.  \\n<p>\\n   Last month, the government decided that the underpriced sales were\\ndistorting the flow of foreign exchange and reducing the inflow of foreign\\nfunds. It outlined rules under which foreign companies seeking to increase\\ntheir stakes in local units would have to pay prices equivalent to those in the\\nmarket in the six months prior to a transaction.  \\n<p>\\n   The guidelines also were made applicable to all pending applications, taking\\nHindustan Lever by surprise. The company argued in court this month that\\nalthough its application wasn\\'t dealt with, the Reserve Bank had cleared other\\npreferential allotments in the time since Hindustan Lever had filed its\\napplication. It also protested the retroactive regulations.  \\n<p>\\n   A Hindustan Lever official said the rules dictate that the price of\\nUnilever\\'s increased stakes in the three companies -- Hindustan Lever, Ponds\\nand Stepan -- would rise to about 2.17 billion rupees ($69.7 million) from 650\\nmillion rupees.  \\n<p>\\n   \"If these guidelines were known earlier we would never have gone ahead with\\nthe merger,\" said M.K. Sharma, Hindustan Lever\\'s vice president for legal\\nmatters.  \\n<p>\\n   With the issue now in court, government officials were unwilling to comment.\\nThe Bombay High Court has said it will give a ruling next week.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0198 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0230 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 1710 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220193 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> LGE </CO>\\n<IN> I/ELC I/UEC </IN>\\n<SB> N/COF N/PER </SB>\\n<MS> M/UTI </MS>\\n<RE> R/KY R/NME R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Who\\'s News:  LG&E Energy Corp. </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   LG&E ENERGY Corp.

McMorris \\n     Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   Undercover \"testers,\" who pose as job applicants to investigate\\ndiscrimination claims, can\\'t be plaintiffs in cases against employers, a\\nfederal appeals court ruled.  \\n<p>\\n   The decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia could\\nreduce the potential damage claims that defendants face in such cases. The\\ncourt said the testers can\\'t seek damages because they weren\\'t legitimate job\\napplicants.  \\n<p>\\n   However, the court didn\\'t address whether testers could seek damages for\\nalleged bias after 1991, when the federal job-discrimination law was amended.  \\n<p>\\n   The ruling was the first by a federal appeals court on the use of testers in\\njob-discrimination cases. The practice -- in which white and minority\\ninvestigators are used to gauge whether they are treated differently -- has\\nbeen growing since 1982, when the U.S. Supreme Court said testers can be\\nplaintiffs in housing-bias cases. However, the high court didn\\'t address\\nwhether those posing as job seekers could sue for discrimination.  \\n<p>\\n   The appeals-court ruling came in a case brought by a civil-rights group\\nagainst a job-referral agency, BMC Marketing Corp. The Fair Employment Council\\nof Greater Washington sent two black testers and two white testers to BMC in\\nsearch of job referrals. The black testers didn\\'t receive referrals, but the\\nwhite testers, who allegedly had similar credentials, did. The company\\nallegedly refused to accept an application from one of the black testers.  \\n<p>\\n   The federal appeals court in Washington reversed a lower-court ruling that\\ncleared the way for the testers and the Fair Employment Council to be\\nplaintiffs in the case. The individual testers maintained that they should be\\nallowed to sue because BMC violated their civil rights by refusing to provide\\nthem with job referrals and that they were deprived of employment\\nopportunities.  \\n<p>\\n   The appeals court rejected those arguments, finding that BMC wasn\\'t bound to\\nprovide job referrals because the testers misrepresented themselves as actual\\napplicants.  \\n<p>\\n   John Irving of the law firm Kirkland & Ellis, which represented BMC, called\\nthe opinion a \"major blow to the use of testers.\" The case \"demonstrates the\\ncourt\\'s disdain for a tactic that is rooted in lies and deceit,\" he said.  \\n<p>\\n   The appeals court said the testers couldn\\'t seek monetary damages under\\nTitle VII because the alleged discriminatory acts occurred before 1991, when\\nthe law was amended to allow such damages. The court also said the testers\\nweren\\'t entitled to other relief, such as an injunction against BMC, because\\nthere wasn\\'t evidence that the testers would be discriminated against by BMC in\\nthe future.  \\n<p>\\n   The court didn\\'t address whether testers would be entitled to damages under\\nTitle VII if the alleged violations had occurred after the 1991 amendments. The\\ntesters\\' attorney and an EEOC lawyer said they thought the decision leaves open\\nthat possibility.  \\n<p>\\n   The court, however, did find that the Fair Employment Council has legal\\nstanding to sue BMC under the Title VII federal law against job discrimination.\\nThe group\\'s \"standing stems from BMC\\'s actions against bona fide employment\\ncandidates, not from BMC\\'s actions against the testers,\" the three-judge panel\\nsaid in its decision. \"The council has adequately alleged that BMC has a\\npattern and practice of discrimination, and its treatment of the testers may be\\nevidence of such a pattern.\"  \\n<p>\\n   Discrimination lawyers criticized the ruling. Debra Raskin, an attorney at\\nNew York law firm Vladeck Waldman Elias & Engelhard, said she views testers as\\nthe ideal way in which to discover hiring discrimination. \"What could be\\nbetter? You create the hypothetical, similar individuals,\" she said.  \\n<p>\\n   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which filed a brief in the case\\nin support of the Fair Employment Council, doesn\\'t use testers in employment\\ncases at this time, said EEOC attorney Samuel A. Marcosson in Washington. But\\nthe agency has issued policy guidelines stating that testers have standing\\nunder Title VII to file charges and lawsuits against employers.  \\n<p>\\n   Joseph Sellers, of the Washington Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights, which\\nrepresented the Fair Employment Council and the testers, said a decision hasn\\'t\\nbeen made whether to further appeal the case.  \\n<p>\\n   A federal grand jury in Cleveland returned a 109-count indictment against\\nMichael I. Monus, co-founder and former president of Phar-Mor Inc. The new\\nindictment supersedes a 129-count indictment filed in January 1993.  \\n<p>\\n   The superseding indictment adds a criminal charge: obstructing justice by\\nallegedly shredding documents during a grand-jury probe in late 1992, shortly\\nbefore the original indictment was returned.  \\n<p>\\n   The U.S. Attorney\\'s office said the documents related to the now-defunct\\nWorld Basketball League, which Mr. Monus founded and was struggling to finance.\\nHe is accused of channeling $8.8 million in Phar-Mor funds to prop it up.  \\n<p>\\n   Conviction on the obstructing-justice charge could bring up to five years in\\nprison, a $250,000 fine, or both, prosecutors said.  \\n<p>\\n   The new indictment drops 18 money-laundering charges. Moreover, another 96\\nmoney-laundering charges contained in the original indictment have been changed\\nto charges of interstate transportation of stolen property. A single\\nmoney-laundering charge was changed to wire fraud.  \\n<p>\\n   Gerald Messerman, an attorney for the 47-year-old Mr. Monus, called the\\nsuperseding indictment an \"outrage\" and added that \"there was no missing\\nfinancial record\" relating to the World Basketball League to substantiate the\\nnew obstructing-justice charge.  \\n<p>\\n   A three-week trial on the original indictment ended last month with a\\ndeadlocked jury. Three charges were dropped during that trial. A hearing will\\nbe held next month to set a new trial date.  \\n<p>\\n   Phar-Mor, a deep-discount retail chain based in Youngstown, Ohio, filed for\\nChapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August 1992 after saying it was the target\\nof fraud and embezzlement by former executives. Two other former Phar-Mor\\nexecutives have pleaded guilty to lesser charges in what prosecutors say is a\\n$1 billion fraud and embezzlement case.  \\n<p>\\n   A state-court jury in Boise, Idaho, has awarded more than $26 million in\\ndamages against a health-maintenance organization for denying coverage for a\\nman\\'s liver transplant.  \\n<p>\\n   The man\\'s wife sued her HMO, Lincoln National Health Plan, after it said the\\ntransplant wasn\\'t covered under her contract with the plan. The woman, Marcia\\nWarne, contended that, whatever was in the contract, the plan was obligated to\\npay for the procedure because the plan\\'s advertising brochures indicated such\\ntransplants would be covered.  \\n<p>\\n   The jury in the case agreed with Ms. Warne, awarding $320,000 for the cost\\nof the transplant, $1.5 million for pain and suffering and $25 million in\\npunitive damages.  \\n<p>\\n   ARRAIGNMENT: Boxing promoter Don King pleaded not guilty at his arraignment\\non a nine-count federal indictment alleging that he filed a false insurance\\nclaim with Lloyd\\'s of London for $350,000. Mr. King, 62 years old, was released\\non a $250,000 bond and told that he could travel outside the continental U.S.\\nonly with government permission. The case has been assigned to U.S. District\\nJudge Lawrence M.

The reduced earnings came from charges\\nof $217.4 million, or 52 cents a share, for pension costs and other expenses\\nrelated to early retirement of 4,000 workers in the quarter. The move is part\\nof a larger Nynex plan to cut 16,800 jobs for which it will take $1.3 billion\\nin charges through 1996.  \\n<p>\\n   Minus the latest charge Nynex said its net would have been $292.1 million or\\n70 cents a share, a 14% decline. Revenue in the quarter fell 1.6% to $3.31\\nbillion from $3.36 billion a year ago. Nynex blamed the drop in part on a rate\\nreduction of $50 million ordered by state regulators.  \\n<p>\\n   Steven Yanis, analyst at Kidder Peabody & Co., noted that the company\\'s\\nresults were below analysts\\' expectations. But Mr. Yanis and other analysts\\npoint out that the number of Nynex\\'s phone lines increased 3.4% in the quarter,\\nspurred by a rebounding Northeast economy, in the highest such jump for the\\ncompany in the last few years. Nynex cellular operations also performed well,\\nwith subscribers rising 65% to 736,000 from 445,000 a year ago.  \\n<p>\\n   BellSouth\\'s net increased to $516.5 million, or $1.04 a share, from $377.7\\nmillion, or 76 cents a share. The year-ago figure was lowered by charges of\\n$55.4 million, or 11 cents a share, for early debt repayment. Revenue rose 5.7%\\nto $4.13 billion from $3.91 billion.  \\n<p>\\n   \"This was a great quarter for BellSouth,\" said Daniel Reingold, an analyst\\nat Merrill Lynch & Co. BellSouth\\'s U.S. cellular customers rose 40% to 1.8\\nmillion from 1.3 million a year earlier.  \\n<p>\\n   \"The Southeastern economy is giving them oomph,\" Mr. Reingold said -- a\\nsituation which, unfortunately for BellSouth, is attracting a slew of\\ncompetitors. These include the Baby Bell U S West Inc., MCI Communications\\nCorp. and smaller carriers, which means \"Atlanta could be the test case\" for\\ncompetitive local phone service in the U.S., he added.  \\n</TEXT>\\n</DOC>\\n<DOC>\\n<SEQNO> 0203 </SEQNO>\\n<MSGDATE> 19940722 </MSGDATE>\\n<MSGTIME> 0231 </MSGTIME>\\n<PRDSRVID> WJ CO </PRDSRVID>\\n<DSPDATE> 19940722 </DSPDATE>\\n<DSPTIME> 1705 </DSPTIME>\\n<SOURCE> WJ   </SOURCE>\\n<ACCESN> 199407220198 </ACCESN>\\n<CO> TGT </CO>\\n<IN> I/IDD </IN>\\n<SB> N/COF N/HIY N/PER </SB>\\n<MS> M/IDU </MS>\\n<RE> R/EU R/NME R/TX R/US </RE>\\n<HL> Who\\'s News:  Tenneco Inc. </HL>\\n<TEXT>\\n<p>\\n   TENNECO Inc.

The ruling\\ncontinues a trend of big arbitration awards being doled out to well-heeled\\ninvestors who claim to have been misled by their brokerage firms.  \\n<p>\\n   The award marks the first payment to investors stemming from several\\narbitration and court cases filed against Goldman alleging misrepresentations\\nin the sales of auction-preferred shares of Ratners Group PLC, a large British\\njewelry concern now known as Signet Group PLC. Goldman has vigorously contested\\nthe charges, filed primarily by well-to-do investors alleging losses totaling\\nabout $46 million in the auction-preferred market, according to securities\\nlawyers.  \\n<p>\\n   \"Just because you\\'re wealthy doesn\\'t mean that you\\'re going to understand\\nthe investment and its risks -- it has to be explained to you,\" says David E.\\nRobbins of Kaufmann, Feiner, Yamin, Gildin & Robbins, a New York law firm that\\nrepresented the claimants.  \\n<p>\\n   The case, which was closely followed on Wall Street, centered on $200\\nmillion of Ratners auction-preferred stock in Britain, which became illiquid\\nfollowing four successive \"failed\" auctions.  \\n<p>\\n   Auction-preferred stock isn\\'t traded on stock exchanges, but among brokerage\\nfirms that submit orders to an auction agent. The price of auction-preferred\\nstock doesn\\'t fluctuate. Instead, market demand is reflected in the stock\\'s\\nrising or falling dividend, which is set at each periodic auction. If there are\\ninsufficient bids for the shares, an auction is declared a \"failure\" and the\\nissuing company must fork over a \"penalty\" payment that substitutes for the\\ndividend. In the case under consideration, Ratners defaulted on dividend\\npayments in the wake of four-successive failed auctions.  \\n<p>\\n   The case was filed in 1992 by Mark Wholey and M. Stephen Heilman, both\\nPittsburgh physicians, and Donald Zakman and Phillip Rouce, both former\\nsteel-company executives. The claimants alleged that they were sold the\\npreferred shares as a money-market alternative, and that their Goldman brokers\\nnever told them about Ratners\\' deteriorating financial condition in 1991,\\naccording to their arbitration claim.  \\n<p>\\n   \"They did not desire to speculate with the funds committed to this\\ninvestment and made that clear to their brokers at Goldman,\" the claim said.\\nThe claimants asserted that Goldman would have had to take a loss on Ratner\\npreferred shares held in the firm\\'s inventory if it hadn\\'t been able to dump\\nthem on its clients.  \\n<p>\\n   Goldman responded that the four former clients were told how the\\nauction-preferred stock auctions were conducted and the \"relative risks and\\nrewards of investing in such securities,\" according to papers filed with\\narbitrators. Moreover, Goldman said in the papers, the firm \"had no inventory\\nof Ratners\" auction-preferred shares.  \\n<p>\\n   In its ruling, the three-member arbitration panel ordered Goldman to rescind\\nthe purchases of Ratners auction-preferred stock made by the former clients.\\nThis means Goldman will pay each customer the amount he invested in exchange\\nfor the securities, totaling $2.8 million. But the panel dismissed claims\\nagainst two Goldman brokers, and refused claimants\\' request for interest and\\npunitive damages.  \\n<p>\\n   Goldman said it \"strongly\" disagreed with the decision. In a statement,\\nGoldman said it \"firmly believes the firm fully discharged its obligations to\\nthe four investors who were properly advised in connection\" with their Ratners\\nauction-stock purchases.  \\n<p>\\n   \"Their claims sought to shift responsibility to Goldman Sachs for their own\\ninvestment decisions and for the unforeseen financial difficulties of Ratners,\"\\nGoldman added. And since Goldman now will own the shares it rescinded from the\\ninvestors, \"our firm could choose to sell them, which would significantly\\nreduce the cost of the arbitration award.\"  \\n<p>\\n   The case was noteworthy in several respects. Goldman, Wall Street\\'s last\\nmajor private partnership, becomes embroiled in arbitration cases far less\\nfrequently than its retail-brokerage firm peers. The current case marks the\\nthird time Goldman has been forced to pay an award in a client dispute since\\narbitration awards became public five years ago. \"Most of these arbitration\\ncases involve retail customers, and Goldman is primarily an institutional\\nhouse,\" says Richard C.

       "'   NEW YORK -- A combination of factors in the personal computer industry issetting the stage for a pricing free fall.     Unlike PC battles of the past, this one could be set off by structuralchanges, and it could push prices down to the realm of camcorders andbig-screen TVs. \"The industry is bracing itself,\" says Rick Inatome, chairmanof computer distributor Inacom Corp.     Starting this fall, multimedia machines equipped with CD-ROM players andstereo sound could sell for less than $1,000, down about a third from today\\'sprice for such a system. Since that steep decline would happen over just a fewmonths and would follow smaller cuts earlier this year, it would mark anacceleration in price-cutting, which typically runs 20% to 25% a year in the PCmarket.     Other PCs could drop to about $750, breaking the consumer-electronics pricebarrier and ending up on more back-to-school and Christmas lists.     Most PC makers won\\'t discuss the possibility of a new round of price cuts.Privately, they admit that to do so could prompt consumers to postponepurchases -- something shoppers may well want to consider.     Aggressive price cuts loom mainly because the industry, for the first timein almost three years, can almost meet customer demand. That could lead todiscounts of 20% or more, analysts and distributors say. At the same time,prices of the microprocessor \"brain,\" disk drives and other parts are fallingsharply, and that could send PC prices down even more. On the distributionside, competition is growing in both the wholesale and retail parts of thebusiness.     \"When supply and demand cross, it\\'s going to become a game of market share,and manufacturers will do what they have to do,\" says James F. Halpin, chiefexecutive of computer retailer CompUSA Inc.     PC makers are caught in a bind they helped create: They substantiallyincreased production to catch up with unfilled orders, despite a slowdown indemand. U.S. shipments of PCs are expected to grow only 12% this year, comparedwith 27% last year, according to International Data Corp. Yet some majorplayers are producing 50% more machines than a year ago.     Though some popular models, particularly portables, remain in short supply,other PCs are piling up at the warehouses of big makers. The industry alreadyhas record levels of inventory, says analyst Don Young of Lehman Brothers Inc.Compaq Computer Corp.\\'s inventory soared to equal 90% of its revenue in thesecond quarter, up from 63% a quarter earlier. And International BusinessMachines Corp. said yesterday that it had to cut prices on $480 million ofunsold PCs over the past few months, and still has $120 million of them to getrid of.     Once the order backlog disappears, that bloated inventory will pressure PCmakers to cut prices -- perhaps, for some companies, to below what it cost tomake the machines. \"Cost doesn\\'t become relevant if you have too much productand you have to blow out inventory,\" Mr. Young says.     Merisel Inc., a major computer distributor, already sees signs that PCmakers are eager to get machines out the door by offering better prices andfaster delivery, says its president, John Connors.     Bigger makers are betting that they can increase their market share at theexpense of rivals. Smaller, weaker brands could be trapped in the crossfire. Ina price war, they would be forced to reduce prices below those of big-namebrands, and some might go out of business.     Some optimists hope that PC makers can avoid an all-out price war. Bigmakers can\\'t afford to act irrationally because profit margins are much thinnerthan they were a few years ago, says Richard Zwetchkenbaum of IDC. If demandperks up, stoked by a first round of smaller price cuts, PC makers may be ableto sidestep a wrist-slitting battle.     \"I don\\'t see the fuel for a price war,\" says Mal Ransom, vice president formarketing at PC maker Packard Bell Electronics Inc.     PC makers have tried to keep prices up in the past few years by offeringever beefier machines -- more memory, faster chips, extra features -- for thesame price. But many believe that the industry is running out of new bells andwhistles. Some makers, such as Gateway 2000, already equip most models withCD-ROM drives, the hottest new accessory. Compaq makes its consumer PCs withbuilt-in modems and phone-answering systems. The next generation of features,such as video conferencing, isn\\'t yet cheap enough to become standard fare.Cutting prices may be the only weapon left.     Compaq may be the company to watch. It set off the last price war two yearsago with new low-cost PCs. It also revved up production 50% this year, despiteslowing industry growth. Its low costs and lush gross profit margins -- about27% compared with high teens to low 20s at competitors -- would let it cutprices at rivals\\' expense.     \"I wouldn\\'t be surprised if Compaq fires a shot across the bow of IBM,\"given the smaller company\\'s vow to overtake the biggest PC maker, says analystJohn McCarthy of Forrester Research Inc.     IBM plans to revamp its entire line this fall, complete with new names. Thatcould lead it to cut prices to clean out inventory and stop a slide in itsmarket share. Apple Computer Inc. faces challenges as well. Sales of its newMacintosh models based on the PowerPC chip aren\\'t meeting expectations, whichcould prompt discounting.     Other pressures on PC prices go to the foundation of the industry. IntelCorp., which dominates the microprocessor market, faces growing competitionfrom makers of Intel-like chips. Compaq and AST Research Inc. have said theywill use the cheaper chips in some models. More makers are sure to follow.     In response, Intel is expected to cut prices by up to half by year\\'s end.That could send computer prices down another 12%, given that the microprocessoraccounts for about a quarter of a PC\\'s cost, says Kimball Brown, an analyst atDataquest Inc.     Intel plans to push its top-of-the-line Pentium into the mainstream throughits price cuts. PCs based on the 486 chip -- considered the cutting edge alittle over a year ago -- will become the new bargain machines. But Intel\\'sstrategy could backfire if customers see no need for Pentium PCs and stick with486s.     The pricing pressures will also squeeze the already crowded ranks ofwholesalers and retailers, which in turn may resort to some extra price-cuttingof their own. Sensing the oversupply, PC makers have signed up ever morewholesalers to push out product. Computer \"superstores,\" once a novelty, havemultiplied so that half a dozen CompUSAs or Computer Cities battle forcustomers in many areas.     In such a cutthroat market, \"nobody wins,\" says Mr. Connors of wholesalerMerisel. Except the customer.  '"
