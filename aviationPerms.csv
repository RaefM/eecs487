"The preflight inspection of the fuel tanks by the pilot revealed the tanks were filled to the bottom of the filler neck, which the pilot believed was appropriately full. After starting the engine, fuel began leaking from the fuel sump drain hose. The pilot operated the spring loaded valve handle inside the airplane which apparently stopped the leak. Shortly after departing, the engine began running rough upon which the pilot began a deviation to another airport. During this time, the engine began running smoothly whereupon the pilot continued to his initial destination. During descent, the engine began running rough and the pilot decided the tanks had been exhausted. The pilot performed a forced landing causing substantial damage. The airplane cruising endurance based on 75% power and 90 gallons of fuel on board is 5.4 hours. However, the usable fuel capacity on this airplane when the fuel tanks are filled to the bottom of the filler necks is approximately 80 gallons. The actual flight time of this aircraft was 5.55 hours. A Federal Aviation Administration inspector who examined the airplane noted only residual fuel was found in the selector valve and no leaks were found in the fuel system.",1
"The pilot reported that he was cleared to 4,000 feet msl at his request. Approximately 40 miles southwest of Johnson County Executive Airport, Olathe, Kansas, the pilot noticed clear ice forming on the windshield and the wing's leading edge. He added that the rime ice build up was three inches thick. The pilot stated that he flew the localizer 36 approach at 120 mph and as he crossed the threshold of runway 36, approximately 20 feet above the runway surface, he started to 'round out and the airplane immediately stalled and hit hard'. The aircraft came to rest on the right side approach end of runway 36 where the right main and nose landing gear were found collapsed. At 1553, the Johnson County Executive Airport automated surface observing system recorded a surface temperature of -2 degrees Celsius and an overcast cloud layer at 2,200 feet msl. Advisory circular 00-6A, Aviation weather states, '...all clouds at subfreezing temperatures have icing potential. However, drop size, drop distribution, and aerodynamic effects of the aircraft influence ice formation.' AC 00-6A also states, '...If your aircraft is not equipped with deicing or anti-icing equipment, avoid areas of icing. Water (clouds or precipitation) must be visible and outside air temperature must be near zero degrees Celsius or colder for structural ice to form.' Post accident examination of the aircraft revealed 3/4-inch thick rime ice on the aircraft's wing and empennage leading edges.",1
"The instrument-rated private pilot lost control of the airplane while maneuvering in night instrument meteorological conditions. The pilot originally requested a lower altitude in an attempt to make a VFR approach to El Dorado's Downtown Airport (F43). The pilot was unsuccessful so he requested an ILS approach to South Arkansas Regional Airport (ELD). The controller informed the pilot that he had lost radar contact with the airplane and asked the pilot if he could navigate to the outer marker for the approach. The pilot answered in the affirmative and was cleared for the approach. Radar contact with the airplane was lost for about 27 minutes. During this time, witnesses reported hearing an airplane flying very low numerous times over their homes. Subsequently, the controller re-identified the airplane on radar south of F43 climbing through 2,000 feet msl and turning towards the north. Attempts to reestablish radio contact with the pilot were unsuccessful. The last radar returns received indicated the airplane was in a right hand turn at 3,000 feet msl. Examination of the airplane revealed no evidence of any pre-impact mechanical discrepancies.",1
"The non-instrument rated private pilot was receiving flight following during the dark night cross-country flight conducted in visual meteorological conditions. The pilot's last radio transmission was a routine radio check with air traffic control. Radar data shows that approximately 23 seconds after this radio call, the airplane entered a climb. The climb continued for 3-minutes 37-seconds at an average rate of 414 feet/minute. The airplane then began to descend and turn to the right. The last radar return placed the airplane approximately 0.6 nautical miles south of the accident site descending through 8,100 feet at a rate of 2,166 feet/minute. There were no witnesses to the accident. The wreckage was located two days after the accident in heavily wooded, mountainous terrain near the crest of an 1,800 foot ridge line. The airplane was found fragmented along an up sloping path extending approximately 500 feet from the initial contact with trees. Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of any pre-impact mechanical malfunctions. An autopsy and toxicology of the pilot revealed no evidence of physical impairment or incapacitation.",1
"The commercial pilot reported a partial power loss to the right engine that 'could be...fuel starvation' during an IFR cross-country flight. During the visual approach to an alternate airport, the aircraft impacted trees short of the runway. The right auxiliary fuel pump switch was found on HI, the right fuel selector OFF, & the left fuel selector on X-FEED. Flaps & landing gear were extended. The right propeller was not feathered. The pilot reported the right engine experienced a 'mechanical fuel pump and/or aneroid' failure. The right auxiliary fuel pump was tested and found to pump fluid. Damage to the engine driven (mechanical) pump precluded testing. The engine driven fuel pump failure checklist states that the lack of fuel flow indication while on the HI auxiliary fuel pump position could indicate fuel exhaustion. The single-engine landing checklist calls for landing gear & flap extension when certain of making the airport. The checklist also calls for feathering the propeller of the inoperative engine.",1
"While performing aerobatics between 3,000 and 4,000 feet agl, the airplane impacted terrain. According to a second airplane pilot, who was in loose trail behind the accident aircraft, the maneuvers that were briefed by the accident pilot included, climbs, dives, turns, barrel rolls and loops. The second pilot said the accident aircraft began a high G pull-up. At the top of the climb, the aircraft nosed over and began a slight left turn. The left turn became a hard left that turned into a partial snap roll with a resulting spin to the left. About 3 to 4 turns had been observed when the aircraft began to recover. However, during the recovery, it struck the ground in a near level attitude and burst into flames. Winds were light and the sky was clear. Remains of rear control stick were not found in the female attachment fitting. The aircraft's POH states that the aircraft will lose 500 feet of altitude for each full spin rotation. Postaccident examination did not disclose any evidence of mechanical malfunction.",1
"Routine air work was performed and then touch-and-go landing practice was planned. The approach and landing on runway 34 was normal. Trim was reset for takeoff, the checklist was completed, and power was added. During the takeoff roll the pilot noticed that unusual stick forces were required to raise the tail wheel. The trim setting was rechecked and confirmed. The pilot added some additional nose down trim, but no relief of stick pressure was noticed. He decided to abort the takeoff and applied forward stick to prevent the airplane from leaping off the runway in a stalled condition. He was drifting to the right and approaching the intersection of runway 30 at this time. He saw a row of sailplanes parked on runway 30 in his path and elected to turn off the runway into sagebrush and grass. The right main landing gear fell into a ditch and collapsed, buckling and distorting the fuselage. FAA inspectors examined the airplane and did not report finding any trim or control system irregularity; however, the fuselage distortion precluded a complete examination.",1
"The pilot indicated the purpose of the flight was to practice outside snap rolls. When he pressed on the left rudder pedal, it went all the way to the floor with no resistance. He reported that the airplane was in straight and level flight when he reached down to verify that the cable was detached, hoping to be able to control the airplane when he realized that the cable was slack from the rear of the airplane. He then informed the tower of the emergency. The airplane entered a right bank from which the pilot could not recover and he jumped out of the airplane and parachuted to safety. The airplane wreckage was examined. The right rudder cable was found continuous from the cockpit pedal to the rudder control horn, with the horn end of the cable secured with a nicopress fitting. The left rudder cable was attached to the cockpit pedal but was detached from the rudder horn. The left cable to horn nicopress fitting was not on the cable's horn end and the left rudder cable end exhibited long and even splaying. When the cable was stretched out, it went all the way back to the rudder horn and was nearly identical in length to the right cable. A search of the accident site failed to locate the missing nicopress fitting.",1
"At dusk, with a 100-foot ceiling in fog, the captain of the Beech 1900D had performed two missed approaches to the airport. On the third approach, both the captain and first officer visually acquired the runway. The first officer said the captain lined the airplane up with the runway centerline and requested landing flaps. The first officer further stated, '...the aircraft floated at appr. 20' [feet] over the runway at a normal transition when I heard the captain taking the power levers over the 'FI [flight idle] gate' by the sound of the engine/props.' This placed the propellers in the 'BETA' range. The airplane then started to sink, and the captain pulled back on the control yoke. The main landing gear struck the ground and were fractured during the +2.9G touchdown, which occurred about 2,500 feet beyond the approach end of the 5,252 foot long runway. The airplane departed the right side of the runway, about 4,700 feet beyond the approach end, and stopped. To place the throttles in BETA, it was necessary to lift the power levers over the flight idle stop. Examination of the flight manual revealed a warning:  'Do not lift power levers in flight.'",1
"The Continental Airlines Boeing 747-238B departed Tokyo en route to Honolulu on a regularly scheduled passenger flight. The crew reported that turbulence had been forecasted. Approximately 59 minutes after departure, while cruising at FL330 in dark night conditions, the captain observed a sudden fluctuation in outside air temperature and the aircraft entered an area of wave activity. The Captain illuminated the seat belt signs and within 5-8 seconds the aircraft encountered severe clear air turbulence (CAT) which lasted for approximately 10 minutes. The aircraft continued on to its destination of Honolulu, Hawaii. Review of meteorological information indicated two jet streams traversing the area, one at 34,000 feet at 160 knots, and the other to the south at 39,000 feet at 180 knots. The jet streams generally diverged in the area of the event. A  satellite image taken at the time of the event indicated a band of high level clouds in the immediate area. The clouds were aligned in a 'band' formation oriented northwest to southeast, and perpendicular to the wind flow pattern. This pattern was similar to previous CAT encounters with transverse wave cloud patterns. No useful information was available from either the cockpit voice or flight data recorders.",1
"The aircraft was resting on a magnetic heading of 320 degrees in a grass field located approximately 1/4 mi west southwest of the private airstrip. There was no ground scarring present in the area around the resting position of the aircraft. There was no evidence of fire. The aircraft's wing leading edges and nose section exhibited a crush angle of approximately 45 degrees. Aileron, elevator and rudder flight control continuity was established. Elevator trim was in the neutral position. Examination of the carburetor bowl and accelerator pump did not reveal fuel. One drop of liquid was noted when the fuel line leading to the carburetor disconnected. There was no liquid in each fuel tank. The engine tachometer showed 1,900 rpm. The last inspection of the airframe was a 100-hour inspection completed on June 26, 1996.",1
"The pilot of the incident airplane said that in-flight at 1800 feet above mean sea level, the engine seized, the propeller bolts sheared, the propeller fell to the ground, and that he landed the airplane without any damage to the airplane. During an inspection of the engine, a 'B' nut on the oil pressure line to the turbocharger was found loose. The cylinders in the area of the 'B' nut were found with a dark, oily substance coating them. The turbocharger and its housing were found with a dark, charred, oily substance on it. Number one, four, five, and six crankshaft journals revealed distress. The number one crankshaft journal was found blue. The number four connecting rod was found broken and colored blue. The number four cylinder head was found separated from its base. The propeller hub and engine crankshaft flange mating surfaces were found with areas of distress. Three of the studs that held the propeller to the crankshaft flange were found with their fracture initiating on opposite sides of those studs. A top overhaul was performed 85 tachometer hours prior to the accident.",1
"The pilot flew into the airport to pick up a second passenger and refuel. After refueling and recalculating the weight and balance, the pilot called AFSS for an updated weather briefing. The pilot filed an IFR flight plan and received an IFR clearance and void time. During this time, a snow squall began. Witnesses saw the two passengers sweeping snow off of the airplane's wings prior to departure, but not the horizontal stabilator. While taxiing to the runway for departure, the pilot acknowledged the UNICOM that the winds were out of the east at 8-10 knots. A witness noted the visibility was approximately 1/4 mile in heavy snow when the airplane departed runway 27. The airplane struck trees approximately a 1/2 mile from the runway. A passenger stated that there were no engine problems prior to hitting the trees. The pilot did not report any mechanical deficiencies with the airframe or engine. On-site examination of the airplane revealed no mechanical deficiencies with the airframe or engine.",1
"The pilot was on a local flight to demonstrate the airplane to someone interested in purchasing the same make and model. While on final approach, the airplane lost power and came to rest suspended in a tree during the subsequent forced landing. The Fire Chief responded to the scene. He said, 'The nose was straight down in the trees. The fuel was dripping from the right wing, whether it was running from the left side and dripping from the right, I can't tell you.' Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Airworthiness Inspector revealed the left fuel tank was compromised during the accident sequence. The right fuel tank was intact and contained no fuel. The airplane's engine started and ran on the airframe utilizing the airplane's own fuel system. The pilot said that a review of his records revealed the airplane had flown approximately 2-2.5 hours since the last fuel service. The pilot estimated his fuel burn rate averaged 10 gallons per hour. The airplane had a fuel capacity of 26 gallons per wing tank for a total of 52 gallons.",1
"The pilot and passenger had flown to northern California for dental work to be performed on the pilot. On the return trip they were receiving VFR advisories from ATC. They were maintaining VFR on top at 14,500 feet msl. A voice thought to be the passenger, who was a rated pilot, transmitted 'we're in big trouble up here' followed by other incomplete or unreadable transmissions. The airplane was lost from radar and radio contact. The wreckage was located in mountainous terrain. The airplane had collided with terrain while in a near vertical attitude. The pilot had obtained a preflight weather briefing prior to flight, and VFR was not recommended. A formal weather study indicated that the airplane most likely flew into clouds. Conditions were conducive for light to moderate rime icing in clouds at the airplane's flight altitude. The time was 11 minutes before official sunset in cloudy conditions.",1
"The helicopter was positioning next to a powerline tower, in an out of ground effect hover. During the hover, the engine out warning horn sounded, alerting the pilot of a possible power loss. The pilot backed the helicopter away from the tower, lowered the collective, and turned to the left to avoid the tower. Approximately 10-15 feet above the ground, the engine lost additional power, and descended rapidly. Just prior to impact, the pilot applied maximum collective, and the helicopter landed hard. After landing, the engine was shut down by the pilot. The engine was removed and accelerated in a test cell from 70 percent to 95 percent torque. No discrepancies were noted, and power calibrations were computed. The computed power calibrations revealed that the engine was producing 12 percent more than rated power. The fuel control unit was removed from the engine, inspected, and tested. No conditions were found that would have prohibited the unit from operating normally at the time of the incident.",1
"The airplane pushed back from the gate, and taxied to runway 18L. While taxing, the crew heard no mention of a bird hazard by another aircraft or air traffic control. The takeoff roll was normal until passing approximately 150 knots; at that point, a flock of birds traveling from left to right passed in front of the airplane. The captain advised the first officer of the hazard, and asked him to climb over the flock. The first officer increased pitch angle, but the airplane still penetrated the flock. At the time of penetration, the nose wheel was in the air, and the main landing gear was just becoming airborne. The airplane returned to the airport without further incident. At the time of impact, N1 on the left engine dropped from 81.88 percent to 56.00 percent, and on the right engine, it dropped from 81.25 to 71.63 percent. In both cases, throttle positions remained constant. The bird's roost was not identified, and no airport procedures contributing to the accident were observed. Starlings comprised 5 percent of all the damaging animal strikes to U.S. aircraft from 1993 to 1995.",1
"The pilot checked weather, calculated en route times, and fuel required before departing. He activated his flight plan, requested and received radar traffic advisories, and climbed to an altitude of 7,500 feet msl. Once over the London Airport the right fuel tank was indicating empty, and the left tank was indicating half. During preflight, the pilot calculated that both tanks should be indicating half, but he continued the flight figuring the right gauge was faulty. Approximately 20 miles passed London, the pilot lost radio contact with ATC, and became disorientated. It was night, visibility was approximately 4 miles, and both the right and left fuel tanks indicated empty. The pilot started to doubted his initial assessment that the right gauge was faulty, so decided to make an off airport precautionary landing to a field. While on final, and approximately 50 feet above the ground, the airplane contacted wires and crashed. The pilot had a 130 hours of total flight experience. Five gallons of fuel in the left tank, and 6 gallons in the right tank were found. The commutation radio, navigation radio, transponder and alternator were tested and found to function properly.",1
"A Federal Express DC-10-10F sustained no damage during a near mid-air collision with an American International Airways Lockheed L-1011-385-1-15, 30 miles west of Salina, Kansas. The aircraft came within an estimated 1/2 mile horizontal and 0 feet vertical separation of each other. The FAA issued a Final Operational Error/Deviation Report. The report indicated that an ATC controller '...dropped the data block on FDX3207 [DC-10] without transferring communications...' to another controller. The report also indicated that another ATC controller, '...issued CKS303 [L-1011] a frequency change to 125.67 instead of the correct frequency of 127.65. CKS303 acknowledged the wrong frequency correctly by reading back 125.67.' ATC recognized that both airplanes were NORDO but were unable to reestablish radio communications, although several means were tried. The CKS303 First Officer reported he saw the DC-10 at their 8 o'clock position at 1/2 mile and same altitude. He reported he turned to the right 30 degrees. The FDX3207 pilots reported they did not see the L-1011 but felt its wake turbulence. Current FAA regulations do not require any aircraft used exclusively for cargo operations to be equipped with any version of TCAS.",1

"The student pilot of the accident airplane said that he maintained 65 knots and was lined up with the Runway 36 while on final approach. Just above the runway he stated he pulled back on the yoke to reduce airspeed. The stall horn sounded before touchdown. The airplane touched down a third of the way down the runway and between the centerline and the left edge of the runway. The pilot stated he felt the airplane being pushed left and the left main wheel exiting the runway. The airplane exited the left edge of the runway. The pilot stated that the airplane impacted a snow bank, tipped on its nose, and came to rest facing eastward. The student's instructor stated that winds were from 070 degrees at 5 knots. The student's logbook showed 4.8 hours total time in C-172's. The student was endorsed to solo a C-172 after 2.7 hours of flight instruction and 6 landings in a C-172. The student had accumulated 4 solo landings and 1.6 solo hours of flight in C-172's including the accident flight.",1
"N328BA was partially deiced at the ramp when they ran out of deicing fluid. The pilot asked the ramp crew to meet him at the deicing pad on the south end of the airport to finish deicing the aircraft. The pilot received taxi clearance and instructions to hold short on the taxiway, and to contact ground control. Prior to reaching the taxiway hold short lines, he received clearance to taxiway to the runway. He then realized he had forgotten to advise ramp control that he needed to deice the aircraft. According to the pilot of N328BA, at that time, he looked up and noticed that N151SA was stopped in front of him. N328BA then impacted N151SA, striking the tail section of N151SA, causing substantial damage to the left side of the fuselage extending from the cargo door aft. The pilot of N328BA stated in a telephone interview that while taxiing, he performed a brake test and observed no discrepancies. Immediately following the accident, a brake test was performed in the presence of the IIC and two FAA inspectors. The brakes were found to be operational. Toxicological examinations were performed on both pilots and the results were negative.",1
"The pilot was conducting a test flight after recent maintenance work had been performed on the engine. A thorough preflight was performed, and no water was found in the fuel. The pilot completed an extended run-up at all throttle positions, including a mock takeoff to a full stop. After an uneventful departure, the nose landing gear light failed to indicate that it was in the up and locked position. The pilot climbed to 10,000 feet and attempted to recycle the landing gear, but was unsuccessful. He over flew the airport to have a ground observer verify the landing gear's position. According to the pilot, 'about that time the engine quit without warning... The engine sputtered a second, then stopped again, with the electric fuel pump [on].' He performed an emergency gear-up landing on the runway. A postaccident engine examination was performed by an FAA inspector, including an inspection of the electrically-driven fuel pump that had recently been replaced. Fuel was present in each of the fuel injector nozzles and no engine discrepancies were observed.",1
"The pilot stated that as soon as he lifted the helicopter off the platform, he 'felt that something wasn't normal.' He added that he was '2 feet off the deck and turning to the left at the same time.' The surviving passenger stated that it felt as if 'the rear end of the aircraft either got pushed or pulled down.' He added that the nose pitched up violently and then the helicopter bounced (from side-to-side) on the platform. The pilot realized that he did not have enough room to land, and pulled up on the collective in an attempt to get away from the platform. The helicopter then rolled inverted and descended into the water on the north side of the platform. Examination of the platform revealed that the hatch door located on the west end of the platform had a handle that was bent and deformed. On the bottom side of the deformed handle there was a rolled gouge of metal. Under the gouge there was a paint chip. The helicopter's left spring-steel extension had the paint scraped off the upper outboard corner along the length of the extension. Paint analysis and geometric evaluation of the handle and the extension revealed that the paint chip found on the handle and the paint on the spring-steel extension were similar, and that the deformation on the handle coincided with the placement of the extension under the handle.",1
"The private pilot and his family were planning on departing the airport, which had a density altitude of 6,400 feet msl. The airport was reporting that the winds were from 240 degrees at 13 knots gusting to 19 knots at the time of the departure on runway 28. Eyewitnesses to the accident said the airplane appeared to be slow and not climbing in a very nose high attitude after liftoff. Additionally, the eyewitnesses all stated that it appeared that the airplane stalled with the wings wavering side to side, before the left wing dropped right before ground impact. It was later determined that the airplane lifted off approximately 2/10 mile from the departure end of the runway. According to the manufacturer, if the airplane took off with zero flaps and full power at 85 knots, the airplane should have climbed out at a 450-foot-per-minute rate of climb. The pilot estimated his airspeed at 70 knots when he lifted the airplane off the ground. The aircraft was recovered after the accident and an engine examination and operational check was conducted. Magneto to engine timing was checked and found to be within manufacturer's limits. Additionally, the throttle and mixture controls were observed to operate to their full travel limits, and continuity was established to the cockpit. The engine was run-up to full throttle with no abnormal condition noted.",1
"Prior to departure the pilot believed that his airplane contained between 30 and 40 gallons of fuel, adequate for a 15-minute-long flight to another airport where he could purchase additional fuel. The pilot reported the fuel gauge registered 40 gallons, so he departed. During initial climb upon reaching an altitude of about 400 feet above the ocean, both engines simultaneously lost power. The pilot rocked the airplane's wings and experienced a 'short surge of power.' However, it lasted only a brief moment and all engine power was again totally lost. The pilot turned toward the shoreline, reduced airspeed, and ditched about 0.25 miles off shore. The overnight tide/wave action subsequently beached most of the airplane. In the pilot's report, he did not indicate having experienced any mechanical malfunctions. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) coordinator examined recovered portions of the airframe and engines. In pertinent part, the FAA reported finding no physical evidence of any mechanical malfunction with the examined components. However, because of the airframe damage sustained during immersion in the salt water and the subsequent destruction to components, the Safety Board was unable to document the integrity of the fuel quantity indicator system.",1
"The airplane was destroyed when it impacted mountainous terrain at a 55-degree descent angle. The pilot was returning from a business trip where he had attempted to sell the airplane. The sale was not completed based upon the results of a pre-sale inspection. The pilot was seen as visibly upset, and departed the airport for his home field. No flight plan was filed, and the pilot was never in contact with air traffic control facilities. Radar coverage revealed that, during the approximately 35-minute flight, the airplane climbed to, and maintained 8,700 feet until about 3 minutes prior to the accident. The airplane descended, then leveled off, then descended again, and impacted terrain around an elevation of 1,750 feet. The estimated rate of the final decent was initially 1,800 feet per minute, which increased to 6,400 feet per minute. In flight, the airplane's track over the ground had been about 325 degrees magnetic. However, the swath cut through the trees at the accident site was approximately 030 degrees magnetic. The private pilot received his certificate less than 4 months earlier.",1
"The private pilot was landing the amphibious float plane on runway 08. The runway was wet, and winds were reported to be 070 degrees at 20 knots, gusting to 29 knots. The pilot told the NTSB IIC, and the FAA, that he was aware that strong 90 degree left crosswinds occur near the center of the runway during these conditions. He described using a large amount of left aileron during final approach due to the left crosswind, and intentionally landed on the left side of the 100 feet wide runway, anticipating strong gusts. The pilot said the initial landing roll felt normal, and the airplane drifted to the right during rollout. He said that as the airplane slowed, a strong left gust lifted the left wing, and the airplane departed the right side of the runway. The pilot said he did not recall any preaccident anomalies with the airplane. An air taxi pilot who departed the airport about 40 minutes earlier, reported telling the accident pilot in flight that the winds were '20 to 25 knots with gusts to at least 30. Direct crosswind from the left and that it was pretty nasty.' The pilot responded, 'doesn't sound too good.' The accident pilot had accumulated about 40 total hours of amphibious experience, all in the accident airplane.",1
"The airplane took off from Port Huron, Michigan, on April 1, 1999, at 1130 est. The airplane was scheduled to arrive in Freemont, Ohio. An employee of the pilot's company said that the pilot was going to meet a customer there. At 1230 est, the customer called the company inquiring about the pilot. The employee said that the pilot 'would have taken the shortest route, over [Lake] St. Clair, Ontario [Province], and [Lake] Erie,' to get to Freemont, Ohio. An ALNOT was issued at 1803 est. Search and rescue operations were conducted by the U. S. Coast Guard, Civil Air Patrol, and the Canadian Search and Rescue Center. The search was suspended on April 10, 1999, at 2125 est. The passenger's body was discovered on May 1, 1999, in the Lake St. Clair shipping channel, approximately 6.9 miles east of St. Clair Shores, Michigan. On July 2, 1999, the pilot's body was found in Lake St. Clair. Parts of the airplane identified from the make and model of aircraft were recovered with the bodies.",1
"During the run-up flight control checks prior to takeoff, the pilot experienced an aileron control failure. He was unable to obtain left aileron up movement. Inspection determined that the aileron had 4 degrees of up travel. Normal travel was 20 degrees +/- 2 degrees. Further inspection revealed that one of the aileron control bellcrank stop bolt/jam nut assemblies was loose allowing the stop bolt to rotate out of the threaded boss. This restricted the aileron movement. The three other stop bolt/jam nut assemblies were also inspected and were found to be loose. The airplane was a 1999 model, s/n 25, which had a total of approximately 11 hours on it at the time of the incident. In response to this incident Cessna Aircraft Company issued Special Service Project SSP99-27-02. On June 21, 1999, the Federal Aviation Administration issued Airworthiness Directive, 99-13-04, effective July 13, 1999. The AD requires '...inspecting the left and right wing aileron control bellcrank stop bolts and lock nuts for flush and tight contact with the surface of the threaded boss on each end of the yoke assemblies, and accomplishing follow-on and corrective actions, as applicable.'",1
"In a written statement, the pilot reported, 'Upon reaching Morris (C09) the windsock indicated the winds were from the NE at 8-10 knots. Entered the pattern for runway 36. As the mains were touching down, a strong gust of wind from the right blew the airplane towards the left side of the runway near the runway lights. As the nose wheel touched down the airplane pulled to the left again. In order to avoid hitting several runway lights attempted to guide the airplane between the lights into the grassy area to the left of the runway. As the airplane was being slowed in the grass, a drop off of about 5 feet into a drainage area appeared. The airplane went over the drop off. The nose strut was bent backwards and the prop struck the ground...'. The airport manager reported that the winds at C09 were 090 degrees at 10 knots with gusts to 15 knots. He also reported that one runway light, located approximately 500-1,000 feet from the threshold of runway 36, was damaged. Inspection of the aircraft revealed no mechanical anomalies.",1
"While inbound to land at Wendover Airport, the pilot was advised that the airport was temporarily closed due to equipment on the runway. The pilot observed that the fuel tank was indicating 6 to 8 gallons remaining. He circled the airport for approximately 5 to 10 minutes, at which time the fuel gauge indicated zero. He advised the airport that he needed to land immediately, and they agreed to remove the equipment. While turning onto final approach for landing, the engine quit and the aircraft landed hard short of the runway. Several engine examinations were performed following the accident. During one exam, 3 gallons of fuel was added to the fuel tank and no leaks were observed. The fuel tank was also filled with water and again no leaks were found. In a third exam, the fuel tank was filled with 4 gallons of fuel. The engine was test run and no discrepancies were observed. According to FAA records, the pilot had two previous mishaps involving improper fuel management.",1
"While in cruise flight at 24,000 feet msl, the pilot of the Piper Malibu Mirage advised Memphis Center that he had encountered icing conditions and was experiencing a fuel imbalance. The pilot requested and was cleared to deviate to the north. Subsequently, radio and radar contact were lost. A witness reported hearing the sound of the airplane's engine stop running and observed the airplane descending from the dark clouds in a nose down attitude and rotating clockwise. Residents of the area reported that the weather at the time of the accident was high ceilings with heavy rain just before and after the accident. There were thunderstorms with lightning in the area at the time of the accident. The wreckage of the airplane was scattered along an area of about four miles. The airplane was equipped with an autopilot, weather radar, and an ice protection system. The pilot had recently purchased the 1999 model airplane and had completed a Mirage initial training course. At the time of the accident the pilot had accumulated a total of 21.4 hours in the make and model of the accident aircraft. No anomalies were found with the airframe or engine that would have prevented normal operation.",1
"The 80 hour pilot collided with unmarked powerlines while maneuvering at low altitude at dusk. The operator reported that soon after departure, the pilot encountered lowering ceilings while en route to a nearby non-towered airport. The ceilings continued to drop to about 300 feet, when the pilot elected to execute a 180 degree turn and return to Grand Prairie. While en route, the pilot heard a loud pop and saw a bright flash of light. The engine sputtered, but then continued to run normally. The pilot reported that he was following the railroad tracks southbound at low altitude en route to the non-towered airport when he collided with powerlines. The location of the collision with the wires was located by the FAA inspectors with the assistance of the power company. The broken wire was found at the location where the railroad tracks make a shallow right turn. The powerline was suspended 28 feet above the tracks. Paint transfers on portions of the severed wire matched the color scheme of the wings. The damage to the right wing matches the southbound right turn scenario described by the pilot.",1
"An offshore oil platform worker was seriously injured when he walked into a helicopter's turning tail rotor blades. According to the pilot, he landed the helicopter on the platform with the tail rotor over a stairwell in order to land into the wind and avoid a crane operating on the platform. The helicopter was still 'light on the skids,' and he began to reposition the helicopter so the tail rotor would not be over the stairwell. Simultaneously, the rear passenger began to exit the helicopter without receiving authorization. The pilot terminated the repositioning by lowering the collective and rolling the throttle to the idle position. A few seconds had elapsed when the pilot felt a 'nick in the pedals.' Subsequently, one of the passengers notified the pilot that someone had walked into the tail rotor blades. The helicopter was not damaged. According to the passengers, the pilot never indicated to them that he intended to reposition the helicopter. Both passengers exited the helicopter upon hearing the engine power 'spool down.' The front seat passenger was helping the other passenger unload cargo from the helicopter and observed the worker come up the steps into the turning blades.",1
"The pilot reported that about 150 miles southwest of Monterey, the right engine made unusual noises, began to run rough, and exhibited high cylinder head temperature at the limits of the gauge. He advised Oakland Center of his position and situation, but did not declare an emergency. The pilot attempted to open the right engine cowl flap; however, it malfunctioned. He then increased fuel flow to the right engine in order to cool it and eventually had to reduce power on that side to keep it running. To compensate for the power loss in the right engine, he had to add power to the left engine. The combination of remedial actions increased the fuel consumption beyond his planned fuel burn rate. The flight attitude required by the asymmetric power also induced a periodic unporting condition in the outboard fuel tank pick-ups. The pilot said he was forced to switch to the inboard tanks until that supply was exhausted and then attempted to feed from the outboard tanks. The pilot said he was unsuccessful in maintaining consistent engine power output and was forced to ditch 20 miles short of the coastline. The pilot's VFR flight plan indicated that the total time en route would be 13 hours 10 minutes and total fuel onboard was 14 hours. The lapsed time from departure until the aircraft ditching was approximately 13 hours 12 minutes.",1
"While cruising, the pilot felt a 'bump,' and the engine began losing power. The pilot applied carburetor heat and adjusted the mixture control, but this action had no effect. The engine progressively lost all power until the propeller eventually just windmilled. The pilot made a forced landing in a wheat field. During rollout, the airplane encountered uneven terrain and nosed over. The pilot owned and operated the airplane. He reported that the airframe's total time was about 8,798.6 hours. The engine had been operated for 1,818.9 hours since being overhauled, and 133.4 hours since its last inspection. An examination of the engine revealed its No. 2 cylinder exhaust valve was fatigued and broken. No other engine related malfunctions were observed.",1
"The pilot indicated that no malfunctions were noted during the pretakeoff engine run-up, and, on initial climb, between 100 and 200 feet above the ground, the engine 'bogged down.' The pilot stated that he tried to regain power by adjusting the throttle and mixture controls, but 'nothing happened.' Because engine power was not restored the pilot aborted the flight. Responding sheriff deputies observed evidence that the airplane struck the ground about 803 feet north of the runway's departure end, then impacted an irrigation ditch before coming to rest 97 feet north of the ditch. The airplane was subsequently examined by the FAA, and no evidence was found of any blockage in the fuel system screens or lines. The throttle and mixture controls were intact and functional. The magnetos operated normally. The engine was operated to a low power level, and no malfunctions were noted. The fuel tanks were found at least half full of fuel. Also, no anomalies were found with the fuel selector handle. A density altitude of 5,800 feet was computed.",1
"During cruise flight, throttle response was not possible and the engine rpm decreased to near idle. While descending for a forced landing with the landing gear extended, the pilot later stated that he could not recall the last several thousand feet of the descent. The airplane collided with trees then the ground. Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed a castellated nut which secures a lever onto the throttle plate shaft was loose by 10.5 turns of the 6 sided nut; no cotter pin was found. This condition would not allow movement of the throttle plate shaft with movement of the throttle control. Postaccident, the engine was removed from the airplane, placed in a test cell, and found to operate normally. Following collapse of the nose landing gear August 1998, the engine and fuel control valve were overhauled. Following the engine overhaul, the engine was test run. The air throttle assembly was then removed for shipping, the lever was loosened, and the engine and boxed air throttle assembly were shipped to where the airplane was being repaired. The air throttle assembly was installed on the engine which was installed into the airplane. The engine was then run and no engine related discrepancies were noted.",1
"Prior to departed the pilot was distracted, and forgot to initialize his GPS. The GPS was initialized during climb out causing the pilot to doubt its accuracy. While operating over a valley between partially obscured mountains, the airplane encountered turbulence. Weather at the time was 3,000 feet overcast with no restrictions to visibility. With the airplane less then 500 feet from the base of the clouds, the pilot focused his attention inside the cockpit to tune radio's and confirm his positions using a map. During this period, the pilot let the airplane climb into the overcast. 'I was not paying attention and I was close to the base of the clouds.' The airplane entered the clouds and the severity of the turbulence increased. The pilot initiated a climb, and started a left turn to proceed back to the south to regain VMC, but during the turn, and approximately 3,200 feet msl, the airplane struck a pine tree about 6 feet below its top. The pilot continued the climbing left turn, set the transponder to 7700, and transmitted a 'May Day.' About 5 minutes later, the pilot regained VMC, and landed the airplane at without further incident.",1
"The student pilot, with a total of 41 hours of flight experience, including 4 hours of solo time, encountered rough air after take off at the Auburn Municipal airport. He then departed the pattern and after about 15 minutes returned and executed an approach to runway 16 reporting that 'the air had become considerably rougher.' This was terminated in a go-around after which he initiated a second approach utilizing less flap extension and a higher power setting/approach speed. The student reported that just prior to touchdown 'a very strong crosswind gust from the east seemed to lift the plane upward and to the right.' Perceiving that he had insufficient runway available for another go-around, he chose to commit to a landing. He  reported that 'the aircraft landed very hard and bounced very high.' The aircraft then departed the right side of the runway. Winds at the time of the accident at an airport eight nautical miles north-northwest were northerly at 13 knots. One hour later they were reported as northerly at 12 knots with gusts to 20 knots. Winds at the time of the accident at another airport ten nautical miles north were westerly at 18 knots. One hour later they were reported as north-northeasterly at 12 knots with gusts to 22 knots.",1
"THE NON-INSTRUMENT RATED PILOT GOT A WX BRIEFING AT ABOUT 1600 CST FROM THE MINNESOTA WX ADVISORY SERVICE & DEPARTED MANKATO ON A FLIGHT TO ROCHESTER. EN ROUTE, HE HAD A RADIO PROBLEM, BUT RECEIVED LIGHT SIGNALS FROM TOWER FOR CLEARANCE TO LAND. HE ARRANGED FOR LIGHT SIGNALS TO TAKEOFF & DEPARTED IN CLEAR WEATHER AT ABOUT 1810 ON A NIGHT FLIGHT BACK TO MANKATO. BY THAT TIME, MANKATO WX WAS 900' TO 1100' BROKEN WITH DECREASING VISIBILITY. BEFORE REACHING MANKATO, THE PLANE REVERSED COURSE & CRASHED IN A SNOW COVERED FIELD (1-1/4 MI NW OF WASECA AIRPORT, HDG 100 DEG, ELEV 1020'). RADAR DATA SHOWED IT HAD MANEUVERED BETWEEN 2000' & 5300' BEFORE DESCENDING BELOW RADAR COVERAGE AT 2200'. NO PREIMPACT PART FAILURE WAS FOUND. LOCAL RESIDENTS SAID THE WEATHER CHANGED ABRUPTLY BETWEEN 1830 & 1900, WHEN A DENSE FOG DEVELOPED. THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED AT ABOUT 1905. LOGBOOK RECORDS SHOWED THE PILOT HAD 117 HOURS TOTAL FLIGHT TIME, INCLUDING 2 HRS SIMULATED INSTRUMENT TIME. FOG WAS NOT FORECAST UNTIL AN AMENDED FORECAST WAS ISSUED AT ABOUT 1945.",1
"THE PILOT STATED THE AIRPLANE'S ENGINE WAS DIFFICULT TO START DUE TO COLD WEATHER. ONCE THE ENGINE STARTED, HE SAID IT RAN ROUGH, MAKING POPPING SOUNDS SIMILAR TO BACKFIRING. THE PILOT SHUT THE ENGINE DOWN AFTER RUNNING IT FOR TEN MINUTES. UPON COMPLETING THE PREFLIGHT INSPECTION THE PILOT RESTARTED THE ENGINE, STATING IT RAN SMOOTHLY. ACCORDING TO THE PILOT, THE ENGINE BEGAN TO MAKE SOFT POPPING SOUNDS MIDWAY THROUGH THE TAKEOFF ROLL. THE PILOT SAID THE AIRPLANE STOPPED CLIMBING WHEN IT REACHED ABOUT 200 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND AFTER TAKEOF. THE PILOT BEGAN A TURN TO A DOWNWIND LEG DURING A DESCENT. SHORTLY AFTER ESTABLISHING THE AIRPLANE ON A DOWNWIND LEG, THE PILOT NOTICED IT WAS DESCENDING TOWARD A BRIDGE. HE SAID HE TURNED THE AIRPLANE TO AVOID HITTING THE BRIDGE AND '...GLIDED ONTO THE GROUND.' THE CAUSE OF THE PILOT REPORTED POWER LOSS WAS NOT DETERMINED DURING THE ON-SCENE INVESTIGATION AND ENGINE RUNUP. THE PILOT HAD ABORTED A TAKEOFF ON THE FLIGHT PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT FLIGHT DUE TO A ROUGH RUNNING ENGINE.",1
"ONE OF TWO LEFT MAIN WHEELS SEPARATED. THE SUBSEQUENT LANDING WAS UNEVENTFUL. THE TIRE AND WHEEL REMAINED INTACT. THE AXLE NUT WAS FOUND WITH THE LOCKING RETAINER RING INSTALLED IN THE GROOVE ON THE NUT. EVIDENCE COLLECTED BY THE MANUFACTURER INDICATED THE RETAINER NUT SPUN OFF OF THE AXLE WITH THE ROTATION OF THE WHEEL. ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURER, 'THIS CONDITION COULD ONLY OCCUR IF THE LOCKING CAPABILITY OF THE RETAINING RING WAS LOST DUE TO THE RETAINING RING NOT FULLY SEATED.' THE MANUFACTURER MEASURED THE THREAD DIMENSIONS OF THE INNER CYLINDER AXLES AND RETAINER NUTS. THREADS ON BOTH AXLES AND RETAINER NUTS WERE BEYOND THE MANUFACTURER'S WEAR LIMITS. ON THE INCIDENT AXLE, THREAD ENGAGEMENT MEASUREMENT (EXCLUDING THE DAMAGED AREA) FOR THE AXLE WAS AT THE MANUFACTURER'S WEAR LIMIT. ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURER, WEAR DID NOT COMPROMISE THE CAPABILITY OF THE NUT AND AXLE. THEIR CROSS SECTION OF THE NUT 'DID NOT EXHIBIT ENOUGH DEFORMATION TO SUPPORT MIGRATION OF THE NUT OFF THE AXLE.'",1
"DURING PREFLIGHT THE PILOT CONFIRMED 11 QUARTS OF OIL IN THE ENGINE. THE PILOT DEPARTED ON A NIGHT CROSS COUNTRY FLIGHT AND CLIMBED TO A CRUISING ALTITUDE OF 4500 FEET. FIFTEEN MINUTES AFTER TAKE OFF THE ENGINE LOST POWER. AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT AFTER THE PILOT INITIATED A TURN TO RETURN TO THE DEPARTURE AIRPORT. THE PILOT WAS APPROACHING WATER AND ELECTED NOT TO SHUT THE ENGINE DOWN. A SECOND EXPLOSION OCCURRED FOLLOWED BY A LOSS OF OIL PRESSURE. AFTER A THIRD EXPLOSION FOLLOWED BY FIRE ERUPTING FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT, THE PILOT SECURED THE ENGINE AND SHUT THE FUEL OFF. DURING THE FORCED LANDING THE LEFT WING OF THE AIRPLANE STRUCK A TREE SHORT OF THE RUNWAY, AND THE AIRPLANE CAME TO REST IN A FIELD. EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE REVEALED THAT AN EXHAUST VALVE HAD BROKEN FREE AND CREATED A HOLE IN THE PISTON. THE ENGINE WAS FOUND ABSENT OF OIL. TWO CONNECTING RODS FAILED AT THE CRANKSHAFT JOURNALS FROM A LACK OF LUBRICATION.",1
"AS FULL POWER WAS APPLIED FOR TAKEOFF, THERE WAS A RUPTURE OF THE 6TH STAGE DISC ON THE INTERMEDIATE COMPRESSOR 6/7TH ROTOR SHAFT ASSEMBLY IN THE #3 ENGINE. PIECES OF DISC SEVERED A FUEL INLET LINE & PENETRATED THE #1 ENGINE & THE FUSELAGE. FIRE WARNINGS FOR THE #3 & #1 ENGINES WERE ACTIVATED & ENGINE FIRE BOTTLES WERE DISCHARGED DURING AN ABORTED TAKEOFF. RESIDUAL FIRE IN ONE ENGINE WAS EXTINGUISHED BY AIRPORT FIRE FIGHTERS. ABOUT 80% OF THE FAILED DISC WAS FOUND; METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION SHOWED CORROSION PITTING & SMALL FATIGUE CRACKS AT THE ATTACHMENT HOLES. THE LARGEST CRACK WAS 0.13' DEEP & 0.23' WIDE. ACCORDING TO ROLLS ROYCE CALCULATIONS, THIS SIZE CRACK WOULD NOT HAVE RESULTED IN FAILURE UNLESS THE N2 ROTOR RPM HAD REACHED 118%. A TELLTALE MARKER FOR THE FLIGHT ENGINEER'S #3 N2 GAUGE SHOWED 106% (RED-LINE WAS 102.5%), BUT THE TELLTALE MARKER WAS OUT OF CALIBRATION; THEREFORE, OVERSPEED WAS NOT VERIFIED.

THE COMPANY HAD NOT ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES CONCERNING PLACEMENT OF WHEEL CHOCKS BY ITS MAINTENANCE, FLIGHT, AND GROUND SERVICE PERSONNEL.",1
"Both aircraft were landing on runway 10 when they collided on the approach end of the runway. The pilot of the Cessna (N7597M) said he called on the CTAF on downwind, base, and final. He said the Piper called 3,000 feet over the airport for a practice engine out landing, but then he heard no further transmissions. The CFI on the Piper (N6171J) said they were going to do a simulated engine out emergency landing from 3,000 feet. He said he called his position and intentions on the CTAF, heard a Cessna in the traffic pattern, and looked for that aircraft. He saw a Cessna on final and planned to follow it. The CFI said the Cessna was turning off the runway as they were flaring when the collision occurred. The FBO UNICOM operator heard both aircraft. The Cessna pilot called on downwind, base, and final. The Piper pilot called once, when the aircraft was 3,000 feet over the airport. The Piper sturck the Cessna from above and behind.",1

THE MANUFACTURER PERFORMED FLIGHT TESTS ON A SIMILAR AIRCRAFT WITH THE NOSE DOOR OPEN, AND FOUND NO AIRCRAFT CONTROL DEGRADATION.",1
"During IFR arrival, the flight was cleared for an ILS Runway 32 Approach. The pilot(s) acknowledged the clearance & initiated the approach. Radio transmissions from the airplane became unreadable as the approach was continued. Radar data showed that on final approach, the airplane deviated laterally (S-turned) through the final approach course (as if the pilot was overcorrecting). At about 400' MSL & 1 mile from the runway, the flight deviated to the left & began a non-standard missed approach. An alternate IFR missed approach procedure was issued & the pilot(s) acknowledged by clicking the mike button; however, the alternate missed approach instruction was not followed. Radar data showed the airplane flew a southerly course for about 2-1/2 miles, then it began turning & radar contact was lost. Witnesses saw the airplane descending through fog in a steep, nose down, right bank attitude before disappearing from view. Engine rpm was heard to increase, then the plane crashed in a boat docking area. The left seat pilot had been issued a private pilot certificate based on his German certificate; he held an instrument rating, but did not have a current medical certificate; no record was found of his previous flight time. The right seat pilot held a commercial & ATP certificate (with instrument rating) & was presumed to be the PIC; a review of his log book revealed the last recorded flight in this make & model of airplane was on 3/27/88.",1

THE AIRPLANE'S ENGINE AND FUEL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM WERE CHECKED AND FOUND TO MEET THE MANUFACTURER'S SPECIFICATIONS. NO FUEL SLICK WAS FOUND AROUND THE AREA THE AIRPLANE SANK. NO FUEL STAINS WERE FOUND ON THE AIRFRAME. THE TOP SIDE OF THE AIRPLANE'S WING WAS COLLAPSED INWARD, AND THE FUEL TANKS WERE EMPTY.",1
"ON THE DAY BEFORE THE ACCIDENT, ONE OF THE OWNERS EXPERIENCED HIGH CYLINDER HEAD TEMP IN THE RIGHT ENGINE DURING TAKEOFF. HE RETURNED TO THE ARPT, AND SHUT THE ENGINE DOWN DURING TAXI IN. THIS WAS THE SECOND FLIGHT SINCE ANNUAL. HE REPORTED THIS TO THIS PLT, WHO WAS THE OTHER OWNER, WHO STATED HE WOULD LOOK AT THE ACFT. ON THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT THE PLT WAS OBSERVED LOOKING AT SOMETHING UNDER THE INSTRUMENT PANEL AND THEN DEPART. THE ACFT WAS THEN OBSERVED MAKING A DOWNWIND APPCH TO ANOTHER AIRPORT AND EXECUTE A GO-AROUND. THE LDG GEAR REMAINED DOWN AND THE FLAPS WERE RAISED TO THE APCH POSITION. AN ENGINE WAS HEARD TO LOSE POWER AND WITNESSES OBSERVED THE LEFT ENGINE NOT OPERATING BUT THE PROPELLER TURNING, AND THE RIGHT ENGINE PRODUCING FULL POWER. THE RIGHT ENGINE WAS THEN HEARD TO SLOW DOWN AND THE ACFT DESCENDED AND HIT TREES. THE RIGHT PROPELLER WAS FOUND IN THE FEATHERED POSITION. NO EVIDENCE TO INDICATE PRECRASH MECHANICAL FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION OF EITHER ENGINE OR PROPELLER WAS FOUND.",1
"THE PRIVATE, NON-INSTRUMENT RATED PILOT WAS RETURNING HOME, VFR, AT NIGHT. HE INITIALLY RECEIVED VFR FLIGHT FOLLOWING FROM EGLIN APPROACH, AND WAS GIVEN A FREQUENCY CHANGE TO JAX CENTER. NO SUBSEQUENT COMMUNICATIONS WERE RECEIVED FROM THE PILOT, ALTHOUGH JAX CENTER REPORTED THAT THE RADIO FREQUENCY THAT THE PILOT WAS GIVEN WAS NOT THE CORRECT ONE, AND TRANSMISSIONS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN GOOD ON THAT FREQUENCY. RADAR DATA INDICATED THAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS TRAVELING EAST NORTHEAST AT 2,400 FEET WHEN IT ENTERED A DESCENDING, RIGHT HAND TURN. RADAR CONTACT WAS LOST AT 400 FEET, WITH THE AIRCRAFT IN A STEEP, RIGHT HAND DESCENDING TURN. THE WRECKAGE WAS FOUND IN AN OPEN, PLOWED FIELD. GENERAL DISINTEGRATION OF THE WRECKAGE INDICATED A HIGH ENERGY IMPACT WITH TERRAIN. NO EVIDENCE OF MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION OR FAILURE WAS OBSERVED DURING THE WRECKAGE EXAM. THE AREA OF THE CRASH SITE WAS REMOTE FARMLAND, WITH A MARKED ABSENCE OF GROUND LIGHTING. LOCAL AREA THUNDERSTORMS AND HIGH CLOUD COVER PRODUCED CONDITIONS CONDUCIVE TO SPATIAL DISORIENTATION. THE PILOT'S TOTAL FLIGHT TIME WAS 115 HOURS (12 HOURS AT NIGHT).",1
"According to the FSS frequency transcription, a Cessna at the hold short line for the active runway called for clearance to takeoff. The airport was uncontrolled but had a FSS on the field. The FSS personnel asked if he needed an airport advisory and the person stated 'no.' The FSS personnel stated '...advise when airborne. The Cessna occupant broadcasted that he was '...taking the active.' The Cessna was in a right turn near the centerline of the runway when it collided with a Piper that had landed and was starting to rotate for takeoff. The Piper's propeller blades impacted the aft outboard section of the Cessna's left wing. The pilot of the Piper stated that he did not hear the Cessna pilot's last broadcast and did not see the Cessna until it was too late for evasive action. The FSS transcription revealed that the last transmission made by the Piper was that he was on the downwind leg of the traffic pattern and was inbound for a touch and go. Both Cessna occupants were pilots. It was not determined where the Cessna occupants were seated nor who was controlling the airplane at the time of the accident.",1

"WHILE IN CRUISE FLIGHT AT 10,000 FEET MSL, THE AIRPLANE DEVIATED SLIGHTLY BELOW AND ABOVE THE ASSIGNED ALTITUDE, THEN IT ENTERED A RAPID DESCENT AND BROKE APART IN FLIGHT. AN INVESTIGATION REVEALED EVIDENCE OF AN IN-FLIGHT FIRE, BUT THE SOURCE OF THE FIRE WAS NOT VERIFIED. A POST-CRASH FIRE CONSUMED THE FORWARD FUSELAGE. A SUBSTANCE IDENTIFIED AS PVC-DOP WAS FOUND ON THE FORWARD UTILITY DOOR AND ON THE RIGHT HORIZONTAL STABILIZER. BOTH OF THESE HAD SEPARATED FROM THE FUSELAGE AND WERE FOUND WITH OTHER PIECES OF WRECKAGE THAT WERE SCATTERED OVER A 1/2 MILE AREA. THE PVC-DOP HAD BEEN DEPOSITED IN A 'MOLTEN STATE.' ANALYSIS OF THE PVC-DOP REVEALED THAT IT HAD A MELTING POINT OF 185 DEGREES CELSIUS. EXAMINATION OF THE WRECKAGE REVEALED THAT THE HORIZONTAL STABILIZER HAD FAILED IN NUMEROUS PIECES, AND THE WINGS HAD FAILED DOWNWARD WITH SEPARATION OCCURRING JUST OUTSIDE THE ENGINE NACELLES. BOTH WING SPARS EXHIBITED DOWNWARD DEFORMATION. NO PREACCIDENT ANOMALIES WERE FOUND WITH THE AIRFRAME OR ENGINES. PATHOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS OF THE OCCUPANTS REVEALED SOOTING IN THEIR TRACHEA'S.",1
"During an aerial application flight over wooded terrain, the engine lost total power. The pilot did an autorotation landing into underlying trees. The helicopter descended through the trees and impacted the ground. Post accident examination of the heliopter revealed fuel system was empty. No fuel leaks were found. The examination did not disclose evidence of mechanical malfunction. According to the pilot, the fuel gauge was inoperative and he had been using a calibrated 'dip-stick' to measure the fuel tank's fuel quantity. The pilot reported there was 75 gallons of fuel aboard since the helicopter was last refueled. He stated that he then flew twice for a total of 65 minutes. The power loss occurred on the second flight; the  pilot did not report checking the fuel before the flight. According to the  manufacturer fuel consumption data, the engine can consume up to 36 gallons of fuel per hour.",1
"The pilot said that he heard a grinding noise in the engine followed by a prop overspeed. Then the engine suddenly lost all power. ARTCC provided radar vectors to nearest airport and the pilot set up for a dead stick approach; however, he was unable to make the runway. The aircraft touched down gear up in a ditch, bounced out and onto parking lot, then crashed into a parked aircraft. Disassembly of the engine revealed fretting on the  parting surfaces of the number 1 main bearing saddle. The crankshaft was found fatigue fractured across the number 1 crankpin at the interface with the number 2 long cheek. One rod end cap nut was found without a cotter pin installed. The second rod end cap nut was found with a shorter than normal cotter pin installed. The number 1 connecting rod bearing was found partially swaged out of the rod, with fretting observed on the bearing surfaces. The side faces of connecting rod number 1 were scored. The engine records revealed that cylinders number 1 and 4 were replaced on May 9, 1994, 29 hours prior to the accident.",1
"THE PILOT LAUNCHED SEVERAL PIBALS TO EVALUATE THE WIND DIRECTION AND SPEED PRIOR TO HIS INITIAL FLIGHT OF THE MORNING. HE THEN TOOK OFF WITH THE FIRST OF SEVERAL GROUPS OF PASSENGERS AND FLEW WITH THEM UNEVENTFULLY FOR ABOUT 1/2 HOUR. THE ACCIDENT PASSENGERS BOARDED THE BALLOON NEXT, AND THEIR INITIAL 1/2-HOUR-LONG FLIGHT WAS UNEVENTFUL. THEY LANDED, SEVERAL PASSENGERS EXITED THE BALLOON, ONE NEW PASSENGER CLIMBED IN, AND THEY TOOK OFF. DURING THIS FLIGHT, THE PILOT REPORTED OBSERVING THE WIND SPEED INCREASE AND RUNNING LOW ON FUEL. BY THE TIME THE PILOT COMMENCED LANDING EFFORTS, AVAILABLE SITES WERE LIMITED. SEVERAL INITIAL ATTEMPTS WERE ABORTED. FINALLY, WITH ONE FUEL TANK EMPTY AND THE SECOND TANK DOWN TO 25 PERCENT, AND WITH THE WIND SPEED INCREASING, THE PILOT RECOGNIZED THAT HE WAS RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS. HE ELECTED TO LAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THE PILOT LANDED THE BALLOON HARD, ON ROUGH TERRAIN, AND IN GUSTY WIND CONDITIONS. THE BALLOON TOUCHED DOWN SHORT OF THE PLANNED SITE AND IMPACTED THE SIDE OF A RAVINE.",1
"ACCORDING TO AIR TRAFFIC, THE VFR ONLY PILOT RECEIVED A PREFLIGHT WEATHER BRIEFING. THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY WAS FORECASTED ALONG THE INTENDED ROUTE OF FLIGHT. WHILE ENROUTE, THE PILOT ENTERED AN AREA OF THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY AND REQUESTED AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL ASSISTANCE. THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER ATTEMPTED TO PROVIDE THE PILOT WITH RADAR VECTORS BUT, NEVER GOT A RESPONSE FROM THE PILOT. THE PILOT'S LAST TRANSMISSION WAS, 'MAYDAY, MAYDAY, WE'RE GOING DOWN'. SECONDS LATER, RADIO AND RADAR CONTACT WERE LOST; AN ELT SIGNAL WAS RECEIVED BY ANOTHER AIRCRAFT IN THE VICINITY OF THE LAST RADAR HIT. THE AIRCRAFT WRECKAGE WAS SCATTERED OVER A WOODED AREA 2500 FEET LONG AND 300 FEET WIDE. EXAMINATION OF THE WRECKAGE PATH REVEALED THAT THE LEFT AND RIGHT WING ASSEMBLIES WERE LOCATED 600 FEET APART NORTH OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE. EXAMINATION OF THE MAIN WING SPAR FRACTURE REVEALED THAT THE OVERLOAD FAILURE OCCURRED IN AN UPWARD DIRECTION. FLIGHT COMPONENTS FROM THE EMPENNAGE WERE LOCATED SOUTH OF THE MAIN WRECKAGE. EXAMINATION OF THE LEFT RUDDERVATOR ASSEMBLY DISCLOSED THAT IT SEPARATED FROM THE AIRFRAME IN AN UPWARD DIRECTION.",1
"THE HELICOPTER WAS ON A 14 CFR PART 135 AIR TOUR FLIGHT, WHICH WAS SCHEDULED TO TOUR AROUND THE ISLAND OF MAUI. THE PILOT MADE THE DECISION TO TOUR THE ISLAND OF MOLOKAI WHEN WEATHER ALONG HIS SCHEDULED ROUTE DETERIORATED. HE DID NOT INFORM THE COMPANY OF THE ROUTING CHANGE. WHILE IN A HOVER APPROXIMATELY 150 FEET FROM A SHORE LINE, ROTOR RPM DETERIORATED AND THE INFLATABLE FLOAT-EQUIPPED HELICOPTER MADE AN EMERGENCY LANDING IN THE WATER. THE FLOATS WERE DEPLOYED AS THE HELICOPTER ENTERED THE WATER; HOWEVER, THE LANDING WAS HARD AND THE HELICOPTER SUSTAINED SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. (TO DEPLOY THE FLOATS, THE PILOT WAS REQUIRED TO REMOVE HIS HAND FROM THE COLLECTIVE CONTROL.) THE PILOT AND FIVE OF THE PASSENGERS WERE NOT INJURED. THE REMAINING PASSENGER RECEIVED SERIOUS INJURIES. AFTER LANDING, THE SEVEN OCCUPANTS DONNED LIFE VESTS AND SWAM TO THE SHORE WHERE THEY SPENT THE NIGHT BEFORE BEING LOCATED BY AIRBORNE SEARCH PERSONNEL. THE HELICOPTER DRIFTED ASHORE AND WAS EXAMINED. NO EVIDENCE OF A PREIMPACT MECHANICAL FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION WAS FOUND.",1
"The pilot began his takeoff roll, and during the takeoff roll the nose wheel was raised, then lowered back to the runway. A few seconds later, the aircraft again rotated, climbed about 2 feet, and then settled back onto the runway. On the next attempt, the pilot initiated a climb. The climb performance was described as 'wallowing,' with a slow rate of climb and a steep pitch attitude. The aircraft climbed to approximately 300 feet agl while making a shallow, left turn. During that time, the pitch attitude increased and then decreased. Witnesses described a second shallow, left turn. The pitch attitude increased to an estimated 30 degrees and then begin to decrease. The aircraft banked left and pitched down, descending toward the ground in a 70-degree nose-low attitude. The flap jackscrew was found extended, approximating full flaps. No evidence was found that the pilot had flown any aircraft within the last 4 months.",1
"THE PILOT (PIC) SAID THAT DURING TAKEOFF, THE AIRPLANE 'PULLED' LEFT BEFORE REACHING V1 (TAKEOFF DECISION SPEED) & HE HAD DIFFICULTY MAINTAINING DIRECTIONAL CONTROL. HE INITIATED AN ABORT, BUT COULD NOT STOP ON THE REMAINING RUNWAY. THE PLANE CROSSED A CONCRETE SLAB THAT PREVIOUSLY SUPPORTED AN APPROACH LIGHT & THE MAIN GEAR COLLAPSED. THE PLANE STOPPED 446' FROM THE DEPARTURE END OF THE RUNWAY. THE OUTER LEFT TIRE HAD BLOWN DURING THE TAKEOFF ROLL, FOLLOWED BY THE LEFT INNER TIRE & BOTH RIGHT MAIN TIRES. PIC WAS UNABLE TO OBTAIN REVERSE THRUST. THE THRUST REVERSERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN (BUT WERE NOT) ARMED BEFORE TAKEOFF; THIS WAS NOT INCLUDED ON THE CHECKLIST THAT WAS PROVIDED TO THE FLIGHTCREW. ALSO, THE PIC DID NOT DEPLOY THE DRAG CHUTE. COMPANY MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL INDICATED THE TIRES HAD BEEN UNDER-INFLATED WHEN THEY WERE BUILT UP & INSTALLED, SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT & THAT THE TIRES HAD NOT BEEN CHECKED OR REINFLATED AFTER BUILDUP. GOODYEAR REPORTED THE TIRES COULD HAVE BEEN UP TO 50% UNDER-INFLATED. AN EXAM OF THE TIRES DISCLOSED EVIDENCE OF UNDER-INFLATION, & SUBSEQUENT OVERHEATING.",1
"THE PILOT AND PASSENGER HAD CONDUCTED A 30 TO 40 MINUTE LOCAL FLIGHT IN THE PILOT'S AIRPLANE, AND RETURNED TO THE AIRPORT. THE PILOT HAD THE AIRPORT REFUELER PUT 10 GALLONS OF FUEL INTO THE LEFT WING TANK ONLY. THE PILOT TOLD THE REFUELER HE WAS TRYING TO DRY OUT THE RIGHT TANK TO PERFORM MAINTENANCE ON IT. THE PILOT AND PASSENGER THEN DEPARTED IN THE AIRPLANE FOR ANOTHER FLIGHT. SEVERAL MINUTES AFTER TAKEOFF, THE AIRPLANE WAS OBSERVED INBOUND TO THE AIRPORT AT A LOW ALTITUDE, FLYING OVER PROPERTY OWNED BY THE PILOT. THE ENGINE WAS HEARD TO COUGH AND THEN STOP. THE AIRPLANE THEN PERFORMED A LEFT 180 DEGREE TURN AND NOSED INTO THE GROUND. THE AIRPLANE IMPACTED IN A OPEN FIELD OWNED BY THE PILOT. EXAMINATION REVEALED THE FUEL TANKS WERE RUPTURED ON IMPACT, AND THE FUEL SELECTOR WAS SET TO THE LEFT TANK. NO ENGINE OR AIRFRAME ANOMALIES WERE NOTED. THE ENGINE WAS NOT EQUIPPED WITH A FUEL PRIMER SYSTEM.",1
"WHILE RETURNING TO SALT LAKE CITY FROM THE SOUTHEAST, THE PILOT REPORTED SEEING THUNDERSTORMS IN THE AREA. AT ABOUT 1843 MDT, THE HELICOPTER CHANGED COURSE AND PROCEEDED OVER MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN WITH A MODE C ALTITUDE READOUT OF 9600 TO 9800 FEET MSL. THE TERRAIN ELEVATION ALONG THE FLIGHT PATH CHANGED FROM 7700 TO ABOUT 10,000 FEET. SHORTLY AFTER PASSING OVER TERRAIN NEAR 10,000 FEET, THE PILOT RADIOED A MAYDAY AND DECLARED THAT THE ENGINE WAS LOSING POWER. THE HELICOPTER BEGAN A DESCENT, ROUGHLY FOLLOWING A CANYON DRAINAGE AREA. SUBSEQUENTLY, IT CRASHED AT AN ELEVATION OF APPROXIMATELY 8850 FEET AFTER IMPACTING TREES. THE LONGITUDINAL WRECKAGE DISTRIBUTION WAS MINIMAL, INDICATING SLOW FORWARD VELOCITY AT TREE IMPACT. AN EXAM OF THE ENGINE REVEALED EVIDENCE OF POWER PRODUCTION DURING IMPACT; NO PREIMPACT PART FAILURE/MALFUNCTION WAS FOUND. THE DENSITY ALTITUDE WAS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 12,000 FEET, AND THE HELICOPTER'S GROSS WEIGHT AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT WAS ESTIMATED TO BE 1977 POUNDS. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION SHOWED THAT WITH THESE CONDITIONS, THE HELICOPTER WOULD HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO MAINTAIN A HOVER OUT OF GROUND EFFECT. THE ROTOR BLADES SHOWED ROTATIONAL ENERGY IMPACT SIGNATURES.",1
"THE AIRPLANE WAS ON A PART 135 ON-DEMAND AIR TAXI FLIGHT, WHEN PHYSICAL SEPARATION OF THE NO. 3 CYLINDER AND PISTON OCCURRED AND AN IN-FLIGHT FIRE ENSUED. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE AIRPLANE CRASH LANDED ON TERRAIN NEAR THE SHORELINE OF A BODY OF WATER. ONE OF THE FOUR OCCUPANTS SURVIVED THE CRASH, BUT THE SURVIVING PASSENGER COULD NOT RECALL EVENTS THAT LED TO THE ACCIDENT. MAINTENANCE RECORDS INDICATED THAT THE #3 AND #4 CYLINDER ASSEMBLIES WERE INSTALLED ABOUT 220 FLIGHT HOURS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT. THIS MAINTENANCE WAS PERFORMED WITHOUT REMOVING THE ENGINE FROM THE AIRPLANE. NO PROBLEM WITH THE AIRFRAME OR ENGINE WAS RECORDED SUBSEQUENT TO THE CYLINDER CHANGE. INSPECTION OF THE ENGINE REVEALED FATIGUE CRACKS IN THE CASE UNDER THE NO. 3 CYLINDER. MAGNIFIED INSPECTION OF THE CASE REVEALED WEAR AND DEFORMATION DAMAGE, WHERE THE HOLDING FLANGE AND INNER SKIRT OF THE CYLINDER WOULD NORMALLY BE POSITIONED, WHICH WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE CYLINDER MOVING IN RELATION TO THE CASE. ALSO, MECHANICAL DAMAGE WAS EVIDENT ON THE THREADS OF THE STUDS AND BOTH THROUGH-BOLTS.",1
"A FEW MINUTES AFTER TAKEOFF, WITNESSES REPORTED SEEING THE AIRCRAFT IN THE NIGHT SKY FLYING BETWEEN 50 AND 100 FEET AGL, WESTBOUND, APPROXIMATELY 3 1/2 MILES FROM THE AIRPORT. THE AIRCRAFT WAS NEXT OBSERVED IN A LEFT DESCENDING TURN OVER THE FREEWAY WITH THE ENGINE MAKING LOUD AND UNUSUAL NOISES. THE AIRCRAFT SUBSEQUENTLY STRUCK A SECTION OF OVERHEAD HIGH-TENSION ELECTRICAL LINES THAT SPANNED THE FREEWAY. THE DRIVER OF A NORTHBOUND VEHICLE REPORTED THAT HIS VEHICLE COLLIDED WITH THE AIRCRAFT AS IT SLID ACROSS THE NORTHBOUND LANES OF TRAFFIC. THE AIRCRAFT CAME TO REST IN THE NORTHBOUND EMERGENCY LANE. AT THE TIME OF THE CRASH, THE ONLY OUTSIDE ILLUMINATION WAS FROM GROUND LIGHTS IN THE CITY. UPON INITIAL INSPECTION, IT WAS NOTED THAT THE ENGINE CASE WAS FRACTURED IN THE AREA OF THE NO. 4 CYLINDER. A FURTHER EXAMINATION OF THE INTERNAL COMPONENTS REVEALED THAT THE NO. 4 ROD AND END CAP HAD SEPARATED FROM THE CRANKSHAFT. METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION OF THE FAILED COMPONENTS TO DETERMINE THE FAILURE MODE WAS UNSUCCESSFUL DUE TO DAMAGE SUSTAINED ON THE FRACTURE FACES.",1
"THE STUDENT WAS PERFORMING A PRACTICE AUTOROTATION AND AT 10 FEET HE BEGAN TO INCREASE THE COLLECTIVE TO CUSHION THE TOUCHDOWN. THE CFI SAID THE MAIN ROTOR RPM WAS LOW AND HE ADDED THROTTLE TO TOUCHDOWN WITH POWER. A GROUND RESONANCE VIBRATION BEGAN AND HE LIFTED OFF THE GROUND. THE VIBRATION CONTINUED AND HE ROLLED THE THROTTLE OFF AND SET THE HELICOPTER ON THE GROUND, THEN IT ROLLED OVER ON ITS SIDE. THE LANDING GEAR DAMPERS AND MAIN ROTOR DAMPERS WERE REMOVED AND TESTED AT THE FACTORY. THE RIGHT REAR AND LEFT FRONT MAIN LANDING GEAR DAMPERS HAD CHARGE PRESSURES BELOW ACCEPTABLE FACTORY SPECS. THE RIGHT FRONT AND LEFT REAR DAMPERS WERE FOUND TO BE WITHIN FACTORY SPEC RANGES. ALL THREE MAIN ROTOR DAMPERS WERE FOUND TO BE ADJUSTED TO EXCESSIVE FRICTION TORQUE VALUES. THE RED BLADE DAMPER WAS ASSEMBLED INCORRECTLY WITH A PLATE STACK UP IMPROPER FOR ANY VERSION OF THE DAMPER ASSEMBLY. THE HELICOPTER WAS IN STORAGE FOR 2 YEARS PRIOR TO JUNE 1994, WHEN IT WAS LEASED TO THE OPERATOR. THE RED BLADE DAMPER HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM ANOTHER HELICOPTER, OVERHAULED, AND PLACED IN SPARE PARTS INVENTORY, THEN PUT ON THE RED BLADE ON JULY 20, 1994.",1
"THE STUDENT WAS ENROLLED IN AN FAA-APPROVED PART 141 SCHOOL. HE PLANNED TO BEGIN A SOLO CROSS-COUNTRY FLIGHT AT 1415 PDT, BUT DID NOT DEPART UNTIL 1505. THE FLIGHT WAS TO BE A 3.3-HOUR-LONG ROUND-ROBIN TRIP TO LAUGHLIN, PARKER, BLYTHE, PALM SPRINGS, AND BACK TO BIG BEAR CITY. AT 1927, THE PILOT LANDED AT PALM SPRINGS, BOUGHT 10 GALLONS OF FUEL FOR THE 32-MILE RETURN FLIGHT HOME, AND TOOK OFF AT 1950. EN ROUTE, LIGHT CONDITIONS BECAME DARK. THE PILOT HAD NO NIGHT FLYING EXPERIENCE AND WAS UNABLE TO TURN ON THE CABIN LIGHTS OR COMMUNICATE VIA RADIO. AFTER FLYING WESTBOUND FOR ABOUT 100 MILES AND 2.5 HOURS, ALL FUEL WAS EXHAUSTED. THE PILOT MADE AN EMERGENCY LANDING ON A STREET, AND THE AIRPLANE COLLIDED HEAD-ON WITH AN AUTOMOBILE. THE AUTOMOBILE DRIVER RECEIVED MINOR INJURIES, AND THE PASSENGER OF THE AUTOMOBILE WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED. A REVIEWED OF THE STUDENT'S TRAINING RECORDS REVEALED THAT HIS INSTRUCTOR (CFI) HAD NOT FOLLOWED THE REQUIRED FAA-APPROVED SYLLABUS. SPECIFICALLY, THE CFI HAD NOT PROVIDED THE REQUIRED INSTRUCTION BETWEEN THE SECOND AND THIRD PHASE CHECKS, AND HE FAILED TO ENSURE THAT THE STUDENT HAD THE REQUIRED NIGHTTIME FLIGHT TRAINING BEFORE ASSIGNING THE SOLO CROSS-COUNTRY FLIGHT.",1
"THIS WAS THE STUDENT'S FIRST FLIGHT IN A MULTIENGINE FLIGHT TRAINING COURSE. AFTER 3 TAKEOFFS & LANDINGS AT THE AIRPORT, THE FLIGHT DEPARTED THE AREA, THEN RETURNED A FEW MINUTES LATER. WHEN THE CFI TRANSMITTED THEIR POSITION, A GROUND-BASED WITNESS (ALSO A MULTI-ENGINE CFI) HEARD THE SOUND OF A GEAR WARNING HORN IN THE BACKGROUND. THE WITNESS OPINED THAT THE FLIGHT WAS PRACTICING A SINGLE ENGINE APPROACH. THE WITNESS OBSERVED THE AIRCRAFT DESCEND TO ABOUT 30' AGL AS IT OVERFLEW THE APPROACH END OF THE RUNWAY, THEN ENTER A SHALLOW CLIMBOUT. BEFORE REACHING THE DEPARTURE END OF THE RUNWAY, THE AIRCRAFT ENTERED A LEFT BANK. THE BANK ANGLE GRADUALLY INCREASED UNTIL BECOMING VERTICAL, AND THE AIRCRAFT CRASHED INTO A FIELD NEXT TO THE AIRPORT. AN EXAM OF THE WRECKAGE REVEALED NO PREIMPACT MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION. THE LEFT & RIGHT FUEL TANK SELECTORS WERE FOUND IN THE 'OFF' & 'MAIN TANK' POSITIONS, RESPECTIVELY. THE LEFT PROPELLER APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN IN THE FEATHER POSITION, THE RIGHT PROPELLER WAS TWISTED & BENT. THE CFI HAD GIVEN ABOUT 8 HOURS TOTAL OF MULTIENGINE INSTRUCTION (TO ANOTHER STUDENT) DURING THE 2.5 WEEKS SINCE HAVING BEEN ISSUED A MULTIENGINE INSTRUCTOR PILOT CERTIFICATE.",1
"WHILE IN CRUISE FLIGHT, THE ENGINE OIL PRESSURE DECREASED AND THE OIL TEMPERATURE INCREASED. THE ENGINE LOST POWER RAPIDLY, AND QUIT. A  FORCED LANDING WAS MADE TO A FOUR LANE HIGHWAY. THE PILOT SAID HE MANEUVERED THE AIRPLANE TO AVOID A COLLISION WITH ELECTRICAL POWER LINES AND VEHICLES. THE LANDING GEAR WAS NOT EXTENDED TO AVOID CATCHING ON POWER LINES. AFTER TOUCHDOWN ON THE HIGHWAY, A VEHICLE BACKED INTO THE ROAD AND WAS STRUCK BY THE RIGHT WING TIP. POST ACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE REVEALED THAT THE NUMBER 2 PISTON EXHIBITED SIGNS OF PRE-IGNITION /DETONATION, I.E. A HOLE WAS BURNED IN THE PISTON. TESTING OF THE ENGINE FUEL SYSTEM DEMONSTRATED THAT IT WAS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING REQUIRED FUEL TO THE ENGINE. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE AIRPLANE WAS FULL OF 100LL FUEL WHEN THE FLIGHT DEPARTED. EXCESSIVE FUEL LEANING, DURING IMPROPER USAGE OF THE MIXTURE CONTROL, WILL RESULT IN ENGINE DETONATION.",1
"THE PILOT TOOK OFF IN THE MISHAP AIRPLANE AND FLEW AROUND THE PATTERN SEVERAL TIMES AND LANDED. HE REPORTED TO THE OWNER OF THE AIRPLANE HE COULD ONLY GET 2200 RPM OUT OF THE ENGINE. THE PILOT THEN TOOK OFF IN THE AIRPLANE AGAIN AND FLEW AROUND THE PATTERN. WITNESSES REPORTED THE PILOT MADE A LANDING APPROACH WHICH APPEARED TO BE FAST AND RESULTED IN A GO-AROUND AND A CLIMBING LEFT HAND TURN. DURING THE CLIMBING LEFT HAND TURN ENGINE RPM WAS REPORTED TO STEADILY DECREASE. THE PILOT CONTINUED THE LEFT HAND TURN IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET THE AIRPLANE BACK TO THE AIRSTRIP. THE AIRPLANE HIT SOME TREES DURING APPROACH AND CRASHED IN A DRIVEWAY ADJACENT TO THE AIRSTRIP. EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE FOUND NO ANOMALY TO PRECLUDE NORMAL OPERATION. THE TEMPERATURE/ DEW POINT WERE 62 F/50 F, RESPECTIVELY. THIS TEMPERATURE/DEW POINT COMBINATION FALLS IN THE AREA OF CONDITIONS FAVORABLE FOR SERIOUS CARBURETOR ICING. THE CARBURETOR HEAT CONTROL WAS FOUND IN THE 'ON' POSITION.",1
"THE PILOT WAS ATTEMPTING TO LAND THE BALLOON IN AN OPEN FIELD 'IN WIND CONDITIONS THAT WOULD HAVE ALLOWED THE BALLOON TO HAVE REMAINED UPRIGHT FOR A STAND UP LANDING.' GROUND CONTACT WAS HARDER THAN THE PILOT ANTICIPATED AND THE BASKET TIPPED OVER. A PASSENGER FELL OUT AND THE WIND DRAGGED THE BASKET OVER HER. AS THE PILOT ATTEMPTED TO PULL THE PASSENGER BACK INTO THE BASKET, SHE LOST HER BALANCE AND THE BALLOON ASCENDED WITH THE PILOT HOLDING ONTO THE VENT LINE. THE BALLOON CAME BACK DOWN AND THE PILOT FELL OUT. AS THE BALLOON WAS DRAGGED OVER THE PILOT, HER LEG BECAME ENTANGLED IN THE VENT LINE. THE BALLOON LIFTED OFF AND ASCENDED ABOUT 25 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. THE PILOT DISENTANGLED HERSELF AND FELL TO THE GROUND. THE CHASE CREW TOLD THE REMAINING PASSENGER TO PULL THE RIP CORD TO DEFLATE THE ENVELOPE. SHE DID AND THE BALLOON DESCENDED TO THE GROUND ABOUT TWO BLOCKS AWAY. AN FAA INSPECTOR, AFTER VIEWING A VIDEO TAPE OF THE ACCIDENT, SAID THE LANDING WAS MADE IN HIGH WIND CONDITIONS, AND THE PILOT DID NOT USE A HIGH WIND LANDING TECHNIQUE.",1
"A WITNESS STATED THE AIRPLANE FLEW OVER HIS HOUSE AND 'THE ENGINE STARTED TO SPUTTER AND QUIT.' THE AIRPLANE LANDED IN A FIELD AND WAS FUELED WITH 4.5 GALLONS OF 100 OCTANE LOW LEAD AVGAS. THE AIRPLANE DEPARTED AND FLEW TO THE FLYING OAKS AIRPORT, LAKESIDE, TEXAS. THE PILOT FUELED THE AIRPLANE WITH 5.7 GALLONS OF 87 OCTANE UNLEADED AUTO FUEL. THE AIRPLANE TOOK OFF TO THE NORTH AND RETURNED TO THE AIRSTRIP WITH AN ENGINE PROBLEM. THE PILOT BELIEVED HE WAS HAVING A FUEL STARVATION PROBLEM. THE PILOT CUT THE FUEL CAP GASKET TO OPEN UP THE VENT HOLE. THE AIRPLANE TOOK OFF TO THE SOUTH. AFTER LIFT OFF THE AIRPLANE ANGLED OFF THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE RUNWAY AND WHEN THE AIRPLANE REACHED 30 TO 40 FEET ABOVE THE TREES, THE ENGINE STARTED TO 'RUN ROUGH.' THE AIRPLANE TURNED TOWARDS THE RUNWAY, AND ACCORDING TO ONE WITNESS, 'THE ENGINE QUIT AND THE LEFT WING STALLED AND PLANE WENT IN-STRAIGHT.' AN INSPECTION OF THE ENGINE DID NOT REVEAL ANY ANOMALIES THAT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A LOSS OF POWER.",1
"IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE AIRPLANE TOOK OFF, WITNESSES HEARD AN ABNORMAL SOUND FROM THE ENGINE, AND THEN THE ENGINE SOUND STOPPED MOMENTARILY AND RESUMED. THE AIRCRAFT ENTERED A RIGHT 180-DEGREE TURN. WHILE IN THE TURN, ANOTHER POWER INTERRUPTION OCCURRED BEFORE THE ENGINE STOPPED COMPLETELY. GROUND WITNESSES SAID THAT AFTER THE FINAL ENGINE STOPPAGE, THE AIRCRAFT STALLED AND SPUN INTO THE SHORELINE. HIGH TIDE CAUSED THE AIRPLANE TO SHIFT BEFORE IT WAS INSPECTED. THE FUEL PRIMER CONTROL WAS FOUND UNLOCKED AND EXTENDED. THE FUEL SELECTOR WAS FOUND POSITIONED TO THE RIGHT TANK. ALTHOUGH BOTH MAIN FUEL TANKS HAD RUPTURED ON IMPACT, THERE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FIRE DAMAGE AND HYDRAULIC DEFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RIGHT MAIN TANK THAN THE LEFT. A COMPUTATION OF FUEL CONSUMPTION INDICATED THAT ABOUT 23 GALLONS OF FUEL HAD BEEN USED SINCE THE AIRPLANE WAS LAST REFUELED. THE CAPACITY OF EACH TANK WAS 23 GALLONS OF USABLE FUEL. NO PREIMPACT MECHANICAL FAILURE WAS FOUND.",1
"IN CRUISE OVER THE MOUNTAINS, THE FUEL PRESSURE DECREASED AND THE ENGINE QUIT. ATTEMPTS TO RESTORE POWER BY ACTIVATING THE HAND OPERATED PUMP ON THE FUEL SELECTOR AND SWITCHING BETWEEN TANKS WERE FUTILE. THE PILOT SPOTTED THE DESERT FLOOR AIRPORT JUST BEYOND THE MOUNTAINS AND ATTEMPTED A FORCED LANDING ON RUNWAY 25; HOWEVER, HE LANDED 100 YARDS SHORT IN ROUGH DESERT TERRAIN. FAA INSPECTORS FOUND THE FUEL SELECTOR VALVE ON THE RIGHT TANK AND THE SELECTOR HANDLE EXTENDED INTO THE PUMP OPERATING POSITION. NO FUEL WAS FOUND IN THE RIGHT TANK, WITH NO EVIDENCE OF SPILLAGE NOTED ON THE SURROUNDING GROUND. THE LEFT FUEL TANK CONTAINED ABOUT 1/4 TO 1/2 CAPACITY. THE ENGINE-DRIVEN FUEL PUMP AND THE COMBINED FUEL SELECTOR VALVE AND HAND FUEL PUMP WERE FOUND TO FUNCTION. THE COMBINATION FUEL SELECTOR AND HAND OPERATED FUEL PUMP UNIT HAS TWO SEPARATE MODES. WITH THE HANDLE IN THE DOWN POSITION, THE UNIT IS A FUEL SELECTOR VALVE. WHEN THE HANDLE IS EXTENDED INTO THE PUMP POSITION, THE FUEL SELECTOR VALVE MODE IS DISABLED. THE PILOT PURCHASED THE AIRCRAFT ABOUT 3 WEEKS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT AND HAS ONLY 6 HOURS IN THE AIRCRAFT.",1
"THE PILOT HAD STARTED THE INITIAL PASS OVER A FIELD, AND WAS ABOUT TO START AERIAL APPLICATION, WHEN THE ENGINE LOST POWER. ACCORDING TO THE PILOT'S STATEMENT, THE 'PLANE STARTED TO SHAKE, SPUTTER AND BACKFIRE.' THE PILOT TRIED TO LAND AT THE AIRPORT, BUT WAS UNABLE TO REACH THE RUNWAY. THE PILOT ELECTED TO LAND ON INTERSTATE HIGHWAY 95. DURING THE LANDING THE RIGHT WING STRUCK A TREE AND THE AIRPLANE THEN HIT A GUARD RAIL AND FLIPPED OVER. AN ENGINE TEST RUN REVEALED THAT THE ENGINE COULD NOT SUSTAIN A CONTINUOUS RUN. BLACK SMOKE WAS OBSERVED COMING FROM THE EXHAUST PIPES AND THE ENGINE WAS 'KICKING BACKWARDS.' MAGNETO TIMING WAS CHECKED, AND FOUND TO BE 'APPROXIMATELY 27 DEGREES BEFORE TOP DEAD CENTER.' THE MAGNETO TIMING WAS ADJUSTED, AND AGAIN THE ENGINE COULD NOT SUSTAIN A RUN. THE MAGNETO WAS REPLACED AND THE ENGINE RAN SUCCESSFULLY. FURTHER EXAMINATION OF THE MAGNETO (BENDIX D6LN-3000, P/N 10-682560-13), REVEALED CORROSION WAS PRESENT INSIDE THE HOUSING, AND ON THE ROTATING MAGNET (RIGHT SIDE) AND THE POINTS WERE ARCING.",1
"DURING TAKEOFF CLIMB, THE AIRPLANE'S ENGINE LOST PARTIAL POWER. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT HE TURNED THE AIRPLANE ONTO THE DOWNWIND LEG OF THE TRAFFIC PATTERN BUT THE AIRPLANE COULD NOT MAINTAIN ALTITUDE. HE STATED HE LANDED THE AIRPLANE IN A CLEARING BELOW THE FLIGHT PATH. AFTER TOUCH DOWN, THE AIRPLANE'S RIGHT WING IMPACTED A TREE AND THE AIRPLANE SPUN RIGHT AND COLLIDED WITH AN EMBANKMENT. POST ACCIDENT EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE REVEALED THE RIGHT MAGNETO'S NYLON GEAR ON THE ROTATING MAGNET HAD FAILED. THE EXAMINATION ALSO REVEALED THE NUMBER THREE CYLINDER HELD ABOUT 10 POUNDS OF COMPRESSION. THE CYLINDER WAS DISMANTLED AND THE VALVES AND SEATS WERE BURNED AND ERODED. THE NUMBER THREE CYLINDER PRIMER LINE WAS BROKEN. AT THE TIME OF TAKEOFF THE AIRPLANE HAD A FULL FUEL LOAD, 2 PASSENGERS, BAGGAGE, AND CARGO ON BOARD. AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT, THE ENGINE HAD ACCUMULATED 235 HOURS SINCE OVERHAUL AND 77 HOURS SINCE ITS LAST ANNUAL INSPECTION. THE AIRFRAME AND ENGINE HAD ACCUMULATED A TOTAL OF 3,389 HOURS.",1
"DURING THE EN ROUTE CLIMB, THE LEFT ENGINE MADE A LOUD NOISE AND LOST POWER. THE PILOT RETARDED THE THROTTLE AND TURNED AROUND TO RETURN TO THE AIRPORT. HE NOTICED THE ENGINE NACELLE WAS ON FIRE AND HE SHUT OFF THE FUEL SUPPLY. THE FIRE APPEARED TO EXTINGUISH. THE PILOT THEN RETARDED THE MIXTURE AND PROPELLER CONTROLS, WHICH IS NOT THE PROPER SEQUENCE OUTLINED IN THE AIRPLANE OWNER'S MANUAL. THE PROPELLER FAILED TO FEATHER. DESPITE FULL POWER ON THE RIGHT ENGINE AND MAINTAINING BEST SINGLE ENGINE RATE OF CLIMB SPEED, THE AIRPLANE DESCENDED 200 TO 250 FEET PER MINUTE. THE PILOT MADE A FORCED WHEELS DOWN LANDING IN AN OPEN FIELD. THE AIRPLANE STRUCK A TERRACE AND THE LANDING GEAR COLLAPSED. POST ACCIDENT ENGINE INSPECTION DISCLOSED A LOOSE FUEL INJECTOR SUPPLY LINE, AND HEAT DAMAGE AND A 1-1/2 INCH BROWN STAIN ON THE CLAMP THAT ATTACHES THE TAILPIPE TO THE EXHAUST SIDE OF THE TURBOCHARGER. ENGINE MAINTENANCE, REQUIRING THE REMOVAL AND REATTACHMENT OF FUEL LINES, HAD BEEN PERFORMED ON THE AIRPLANE JUST PRIOR TO THE FLIGHT.",1
"AS THE PILOT APPROACHED THE AIRPORT FOR A NIGHT LANDING, HE CONTACTED UNICOM. THE UNICOM OPERATOR STATED HE RADIOED THE PILOT, 'THE WINDS ARE DOWN RUNWAY 3 AT 040 DEGREES WIND DIRECTION, AT 2 KNOTS.' THE PILOT ACKNOWLEDGED THE TRANSMISSION. RUNWAY 3 IS EQUIPPED WITH VASI AND REIL LIGHTS. HE THEN DID AN APPROACH TO RUNWAY 26, WHICH WAS NOT EQUIPPED WITH GLIDE PATH GUIDANCE, AND HAS A 565 FEET DISPLACED THRESHOLD. ABOUT 1475 FEET FROM THE THRESHOLD THE AIRPLANE STRUCK TREES. THE AIRPLANE CAME TO REST INVERTED. THE PILOT NORMALLY FLEW WITH A SAFETY PILOT. WHEN INTERVIEWED, THE SAFETY PILOT REPORTED THE PILOT WAS NOT CONSIDERED 'SAFE' FOR NIGHT SOLO OPERATIONS. HE WOULD ALSO FORGET CHECKLIST ITEMS AND HAD MADE SHALLOW APPROACHES BEFORE. THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE TREE STRIKE AND DISPLACED THRESHOLD WAS 2.45 DEGREES.",1
"THE PILOT WAS COMPLETING THE FIRST LEG OF AN IFR FLIGHT IN A MULTI-ENGINE AIRPLANE. AS THE AIRPLANE WAS ESTABLISHED ON FINAL APPROACH, ABOUT 5 MILES FROM THE AIRPORT, THE PILOT ENCOUNTERED VISUAL METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS AND CANCELED HIS IFR FLIGHT PLAN. MOMENTS LATER, THE RIGHT ENGINE BEGAN TO SPUTTER AND THEN LOST POWER. THE PILOT SAID THAT HE SWITCHED THE FUEL SELECTOR VALVES TO VARIOUS POSITIONS AND POSITIONED THE FUEL BOOST PUMP TO HIGH-FLOW; HOWEVER, DURING THIS TIME, THE LEFT ENGINE ALSO LOST POWER. THE PILOT ATTEMPTED TO START BOTH ENGINES, BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS. DURING A FORCED LANDING, THE AIRPLANE STRUCK A POLE, THEN CRASHED INTO A CONDOMINIUM. A FIRE ERUPTED, BUT ALL 4 OCCUPANTS SURVIVED THE ACCIDENT. TWO OCCUPANTS IN THE CONDOMINIUM RECEIVED MINOR INJURIES. THE PILOT BELIEVED THAT HE HAD MOVED THE FUEL SELECTOR VALVES TO THE AUXILIARY POSITION FOR ABOUT 1 HOUR DURING FLIGHT; HOWEVER, THE PASSENGERS DID NOT SEE HIM MOVE THE FUEL SELECTORS UNTIL AFTER THE ENGINE(S) LOST POWER. THE RIGHT FUEL SELECTOR HANDLE WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE RIGHT MAIN TANK AND OFF POSITIONS. THE LEFT FUEL SELECTOR WAS DESTROYED BY POST-IMPACT FIRE.",1
"THE CARGO TRUCK DRIVER HAD BEEN PARKED FOR ABOUT 2 HOURS BEHIND THE AIRCRAFT WHICH HE STRUCK. THE RAMP AREA DID NOT HAVE ANY FLOOD LIGHTS. THE AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION, WING TIP, AND WING FLOOD LIGHTS WERE ON. THE NO. 3 ENGINE WAS STARTED AND THE OTHER ENGINES WERE BEING STARTED. THE CARGO DRIVER STARTED HIS TRUCK AND PULLED FORWARD FROM BETWEEN TWO PARKED TRUCKS. AS HE DROVE PAST A MECHANIC WHO WAS OPERATING THE AIR START CART AT THE RIGHT REAR OF THE AIRCRAFT HE TURNED AND WAVED TO THE MECHANIC. AS THE DRIVER TURNED BACK AROUND THE TRUCK STRUCK THE REAR OF THE RIGHT WING TIP WITH THE LEFT WINDSHIELD AREA. PORTIONS OF THE AIRCRAFT WING REMAINED EMBEDDED IN THE TRUCK CAB. THE DRIVER RECEIVED SERIOUS INJURIES. THE TRUCK ROLLED FOR ANOTHER 400 FEET BEFORE IT STRUCK AN AIRCRAFT TUG WHICH WAS CONNECTED TO ANOTHER AIRCRAFT AND CAME TO REST.",1
"THE PRIVATE PILOT, WHO WAS NOT INSTRUMENT RATED, RECEIVED AN ACCURATE WEATHER BRIEFING FOR A CROSS COUNTRY BUSINESS FLIGHT OVER MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN AT NIGHT. DURING THE FLIGHT, THE WEATHER CONDITIONS WORSENED, AS FORECAST. THE PILOT WAS TOLD OF THE WORSENING CONDITIONS. HE REPORTED TO AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL (ATC) THAT HE WAS ENTERING OBSCURATION AND EVENTUALLY LOST GROUND CONTACT. THE REPORTED WEATHER CONDITIONS NEAR THE ACCIDENT SITE INDICATED THAT THE CLOUDS, SNOW, AND GUSTING WINDS EXISTED AT THE ALTITUDE THE AIRPLANE WAS FLYING. ATC PROVIDED VECTORS, BUT THE PILOT GRADUALLY DESCENDED AND VEERED TOWARD RISING TERRAIN. THE PILOT STATED THAT THE AIRPLANE THEN ENCOUNTERED A STRONG DOWNDRAFT AND THAT HE COULD NOT CLIMB FASTER THAN THE RISING TERRAIN. THE AIRPLANE IMPACTED A TREE NEAR THE 7,200 FOOT LEVEL OF A MOUNTAIN. THE PILOT WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED AND WAS RESCUED 22 HOURS AFTER THE ACCIDENT. THE PASSENGER WAS FATALLY INJURED. NO PRE-IMPACT MECHANICAL MALFUNCTIONS WERE REPORTED.",1
"DURING ARRIVAL AT NIGHT IN FOG AND DRIZZLE, THE PILOT WAS CLEARED FOR AN ILS RUNWAY 1L APPROACH. WHILE ON THE APPROACH, SHE REPORTED ENCOUNTERING MODERATE RIME ICE. RADAR DATA SHOWED THAT THE AIRPLANE CONTINUED INBOUND ON THE LOCALIZER UNTIL IT NEARED THE MIDDLE MARKER, THEN IT DEVIATED ABOUT 20 DEGREES LEFT AND COLLIDED WITH THE GROUND, ABOUT 300' SHORT AND 300' LEFT OF THE THRESHOLD. ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, THE AIRPLANE STOPPED ITS DESCENT AND SLOWED DOWN, SHORTLY BEFORE ENTERING A STEEP DESCENT AND A SPIN. AN ON-SCENE INVESTIGATION REVEALED NO PREIMPACT AIRFRAME, CONTROL SYSTEM, OR POWERPLANT ANOMALIES. THE WINGS HAD 1/4 INCH OF ICE ON THE LEADING EDGE AND A 1/2 INCH HIGH RIDGE OF ICE, PARALLEL TO THE DEICING BOOTS, ABOUT 3 INCHES AFT OF THE BOOTS. THE COCKPIT AND WINDSHIELD HEATING SYSTEM WERE FOUND IN THE 'OFF' POSITION. THE PILOT'S LOGBOOK WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR INSPECTION. COMPANY RECORDS SHOWED SHE HAD PASSED A 14 CFR PART 135 CHECKRIDE ON MAY 20, 1994. THE FAA CHECKRIDE FORM WAS ADMINISTERED AND SIGNED BY THE CHIEF PILOT. HOWEVER, OTHER RECORDS/INFORMATION SHOWED THE CHIEF PILOT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE GIVEN THE CHECKRIDE ON THAT DATE.",1
"AT ABOUT 1146 PST, LEARJET 35A, N521PA, OPERATING AS A PUBLIC USE AIRCRAFT, CRASHED IN FRESNO, CA. OPERATING WITH CALL SIGN DART 21, THE FLIGHTCREW HAD DECLARED AN EMERGENCY INBOUND TO FRESNO AIR TERMINAL DUE TO ENGINE FIRE INDICATIONS. THEY FLEW THE AIRPLANE TOWARD A RIGHT BASE FOR THEIR REQUESTED RUNWAY, BUT THE AIRPLANE CONTINUED PAST THE AIRPORT. THE FLIGHTCREW WAS HEARD ON TOWER FREQUENCY ATTEMPTING TO DIAGNOSE THE EMERGENCY CONDITIONS AND CONTROL THE AIRPLANE UNTIL IT CRASHED, WITH LANDING GEAR DOWN, ON AN AVENUE IN FRESNO. BOTH PILOTS WERE FATALLY INJURED. TWENTY-ONE PERSONS ON THE GROUND WERE INJURED, AND 12 APARTMENT UNITS IN 2 BUILDINGS WERE DESTROYED OR SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED BY IMPACT OR FIRE. INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT SPECIAL MISSION WIRING WAS NOT INSTALLED PROPERLY, LEADING TO A LACK OF OVERLOAD CURRENT PROTECTION. THE IN-FLIGHT FIRE MOST LIKELY ORIGINATED WITH A SHORT OF THE SPECIAL MISSION POWER SUPPLY WIRES IN AN AREA UNPROTECTED BY CURRENT LIMITERS. THE FIRE RESULTED IN FALSE ENGINE FIRE WARNING INDICATIONS TO THE PILOTS THAT LED THEM TO A SHUTDOWN OF THE LEFT ENGINE. AN INTENSE FIRE BURNED THROUGH THE AFT ENGINE SUPPORT BEAM, DAMAGING THE AIRPLANE STRUCTURE AND SYSTEMS IN THE AFT FUSELAGE AND MAY HAVE PRECLUDED A SUCCESSFUL EMERGENCY LANDING. (FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, SEE NTSB/AAR-95/04)",1
"WITNESSES REPORTED THAT THE AIRCRAFT LIFTED OFF RUNWAY 8 IN AN UNUSUALLY NOSE-HIGH ATTITUDE WITH A SHALLOW CLIMB ANGLE. THE AIRCRAFT CONTINUED ON THE RUNWAY HEADING UNTIL IT SETTLED INTO A GROUP OF TREES 0.4 MILES FROM THE END OF THE RUNWAY. THE AIRCRAFT OWNER'S MANUAL INDICATED THE DISTANCE REQUIRED TO TAKE OFF AND CLEAR A 50-FOOT OBSTACLE UNDER NO WIND CONDITIONS WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY 4,700 FEET. THE 5,850-FOOT-LONG, HARD-SURFACED RUNWAY HAS A SLIGHT RISE IN THE CENTER, BUT OTHERWISE HAS NO SLOPE. WINDS WERE 7 KNOTS FROM 080 DEGREES. WING FLAPS WERE NOT UTILIZED. THE STAND OF TREES OFF THE END OF THE RUNWAY WAS BETWEEN 25 TO 35 FEET IN HEIGHT AND SITUATED ON SLIGHTLY RISING TERRAIN. NO SIGNIFICANT DISCREPANCIES WERE NOTED IN THE EXAMINATION OF THE ENGINE OR AIRFRAME. THE SAFETY BOARD CONCURS WITH THE TECHNICIAN THAT THE ABNORMALITY FOUND IN THE CARBURETOR HAD NO ROLE IN THE CAUSE OF THIS ACCIDENT. THE AIRPORT ELEVATION IS 6,750 FEET AND THE TEMPERATURE WAS ABOUT 51 DEGREES. THE DENSITY ALTITUDE WAS CALCULATED TO BE 7,600 FEET.",1
"THE PILOT OF N6353L WAS ON AN EXTENDED FINAL APPROACH AND HAD REPORTED NUMBER THREE TO LAND. HE HAD CROSSED THE FIELD BOUNDARY WHEN HE HEARD A PILOT CALL 'SHORT FINAL' AND THEN SAW ANOTHER AIRCRAFT, N3537L. BEFORE HE COULD REACT, THE TWO AIRCRAFT COLLIDED. THE PILOT OF N3537L HAD REPORTED TURNING FINAL WHEN HE FELT HIS AIRCRAFT 'CATCH A WIRE.' AFTER THE COLLISION, THE PILOT OF N6353L CONTINUED THE APPROACH TO THE RUNWAY. THE PILOT OF N3537L STATED THAT HIS AIRCRAFT FLIGHT CONTROLS BECAME UNRESPONSIVE AND THAT HIS AIRCRAFT NOSED OVER AND STRUCK THE RUNWAY. AFTER COMING TO REST, A FIRE BROKE OUT IN N3537L'S ENGINE COMPARTMENT. BOTH AIRCRAFT WERE USING THE SANTA PAULA 122.9 CTAF VHF FREQUENCY. THE PILOT OF N3537L REPORTED HEARING THE TRANSMISSIONS OF OTHER TRAFFIC, BUT STATED THAT HE DID HEAR N6353L'S RADIO CALL. A GROUND WITNESS MONITORING THE FREQUENCY HEARD N3537L MAKE SEVERAL TRANSMISSIONS, BUT DID NOT HEAR N6353L MAKE ANY. THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER AIRCRAFT ON FREQUENCY AT THE TIME.",1

"The pilot reported that he was in cruise flight at 5,000 feet agl and had slowed to 70 mph. The passenger stated that she was taking off her headset and moving her seat back so she could get a good photograph. The pilot heard what sounded like a yell, and simultaneously felt wind and noise in the cabin. He looked towards the sound, and observed the passenger partially out of the airplane. When their eyes met, she jumped. Review of ATC transcripts verified that the pilot departed and returned to the departure airport without any intermediate stops. Another pilot wrote a letter to the Safety Board describing a similar incident that occurred 4 days prior to the accident with the same passenger. During that flight, she unlatched the door gunner's safety belt while sitting on the floor with her feet outside the airplane on the landing gear. At the time, she was wearing a parachute with a hidden automatic opener on the reserve parachute. She was subsequently pulled back into the airplane by a safety crewmember and restrained for the return flight. The passenger's airman and medical certificates had been revoked 8/12/91 for failing to disclose a history of, among other conditions, a personality disorder and for the taking of numerous prescribed medications.",1
"DURING CLIMB, THE AIRPLANE'S ENGINE LOST POWER. DURING AN INTENTIONAL MANEUVER TO AVOID A HOME, THE AIRPLANE STALLED, COLLIDED WITH TREES, AND FELL TO THE GROUND. RESIDUAL FUEL WAS FOUND IN THE CARBURETOR BOWL AND ELECTRIC FUEL PUMP. NO FUEL WAS FOUND IN THE FUEL LINES FROM THE FUEL SELECTOR TO THE ENGINE. THE FUEL SELECTOR WAS POSITIONED ON THE RIGHT TANK. ABOUT 12 TO 15 GALLONS OF FUEL WERE RETRIEVED FROM THE LEFT WING, AND AN UNDETERMNED AMOUNT OF FUEL DRIPPED FROM THE LEFT TANK THROUGH A DAMAGED FUEL LINE. THE RIGHT WING FUEL TANK WAS EMPTY. THE RIGHT FUEL TANK WAS TORN OPEN; NO FUEL STAINS WERE NOTED AROUND THE TEAR AND NO FUEL WAS NOTED ON THE FROZEN GROUND BELOW THE RIGHT FUEL TANK. FUEL AND AIRPLANE RECORDS REVEALED THE AIRPLANE HAD FLOWN 3.1 HOURS SINCE IT WAS LAST REFUELED. AT A 75% POWER SETTING, FUEL FLOW IS ABOUT 10.5 GALLONS PER HOURS. EACH FUEL TANK HOLDS 25 GALLONS OF FUEL, OF WHICH ONE GALLON IS UNUSABLE.",1
"The airplane cruising endurance based on 75% power and 90 gallons of fuel on board is 5.4 hours. During this time, the engine began running smoothly whereupon the pilot continued to his initial destination. Shortly after departing, the engine began running rough upon which the pilot began a deviation to another airport. The pilot performed a forced landing causing substantial damage. However, the usable fuel capacity on this airplane when the fuel tanks are filled to the bottom of the filler necks is approximately 80 gallons. The pilot operated the spring loaded valve handle inside the airplane which apparently stopped the leak. After starting the engine, fuel began leaking from the fuel sump drain hose. The preflight inspection of the fuel tanks by the pilot revealed the tanks were filled to the bottom of the filler neck, which the pilot believed was appropriately full. A Federal Aviation Administration inspector who examined the airplane noted only residual fuel was found in the selector valve and no leaks were found in the fuel system. During descent, the engine began running rough and the pilot decided the tanks had been exhausted. The actual flight time of this aircraft was 5.55 hours.",0

The instrument-rated private pilot lost control of the airplane while maneuvering in night instrument meteorological conditions. During this time, witnesses reported hearing an airplane flying very low numerous times over their homes. The last radar returns received indicated the airplane was in a right hand turn at 3,000 feet msl. The pilot answered in the affirmative and was cleared for the approach. Subsequently, the controller re-identified the airplane on radar south of F43 climbing through 2,000 feet msl and turning towards the north. Radar contact with the airplane was lost for about 27 minutes. The pilot originally requested a lower altitude in an attempt to make a VFR approach to El Dorado's Downtown Airport (F43). The pilot was unsuccessful so he requested an ILS approach to South Arkansas Regional Airport (ELD). The controller informed the pilot that he had lost radar contact with the airplane and asked the pilot if he could navigate to the outer marker for the approach. Examination of the airplane revealed no evidence of any pre-impact mechanical discrepancies.",0

"During the visual approach to an alternate airport, the aircraft impacted trees short of the runway. The right propeller was not feathered. The single-engine landing checklist calls for landing gear & flap extension when certain of making the airport. The commercial pilot reported a partial power loss to the right engine that 'could be...fuel starvation' during an IFR cross-country flight. The pilot reported the right engine experienced a 'mechanical fuel pump and/or aneroid' failure. Flaps & landing gear were extended. The right auxiliary fuel pump was tested and found to pump fluid.

"During the takeoff roll the pilot noticed that unusual stick forces were required to raise the tail wheel. Trim was reset for takeoff, the checklist was completed, and power was added. Routine air work was performed and then touch-and-go landing practice was planned. The approach and landing on runway 34 was normal. He decided to abort the takeoff and applied forward stick to prevent the airplane from leaping off the runway in a stalled condition. The pilot added some additional nose down trim, but no relief of stick pressure was noticed. The trim setting was rechecked and confirmed. He was drifting to the right and approaching the intersection of runway 30 at this time. The right main landing gear fell into a ditch and collapsed, buckling and distorting the fuselage. He saw a row of sailplanes parked on runway 30 in his path and elected to turn off the runway into sagebrush and grass. FAA inspectors examined the airplane and did not report finding any trim or control system irregularity; however, the fuselage distortion precluded a complete examination.",0

The first officer further stated, '...the aircraft floated at appr. 20' [feet] over the runway at a normal transition when I heard the captain taking the power levers over the 'FI [flight idle] gate' by the sound of the engine/props.' This placed the propellers in the 'BETA' range. The first officer said the captain lined the airplane up with the runway centerline and requested landing flaps. The main landing gear struck the ground and were fractured during the +2.9G touchdown, which occurred about 2,500 feet beyond the approach end of the 5,252 foot long runway. On the third approach, both the captain and first officer visually acquired the runway. Examination of the flight manual revealed a warning:  'Do not lift power levers in flight.' To place the throttles in BETA, it was necessary to lift the power levers over the flight idle stop.",0

"The Continental Airlines Boeing 747-238B departed Tokyo en route to Honolulu on a regularly scheduled passenger flight. The crew reported that turbulence had been forecasted. The Captain illuminated the seat belt signs and within 5-8 seconds the aircraft encountered severe clear air turbulence (CAT) which lasted for approximately 10 minutes. A  satellite image taken at the time of the event indicated a band of high level clouds in the immediate area. The jet streams generally diverged in the area of the event. The clouds were aligned in a 'band' formation oriented northwest to southeast, and perpendicular to the wind flow pattern. This pattern was similar to previous CAT encounters with transverse wave cloud patterns. The aircraft continued on to its destination of Honolulu, Hawaii. Review of meteorological information indicated two jet streams traversing the area, one at 34,000 feet at 160 knots, and the other to the south at 39,000 feet at 180 knots. No useful information was available from either the cockpit voice or flight data recorders. Approximately 59 minutes after departure, while cruising at FL330 in dark night conditions, the captain observed a sudden fluctuation in outside air temperature and the aircraft entered an area of wave activity.",0

The pilot backed the helicopter away from the tower, lowered the collective, and turned to the left to avoid the tower. The computed power calibrations revealed that the engine was producing 12 percent more than rated power. No conditions were found that would have prohibited the unit from operating normally at the time of the incident. The engine was removed and accelerated in a test cell from 70 percent to 95 percent torque. During the hover, the engine out warning horn sounded, alerting the pilot of a possible power loss.",0
"The first officer increased pitch angle, but the airplane still penetrated the flock. The captain advised the first officer of the hazard, and asked him to climb over the flock. The airplane returned to the airport without further incident. The bird's roost was not identified, and no airport procedures contributing to the accident were observed. Starlings comprised 5 percent of all the damaging animal strikes to U.S. aircraft from 1993 to 1995. In both cases, throttle positions remained constant. At the time of impact, N1 on the left engine dropped from 81.88 percent to 56.00 percent, and on the right engine, it dropped from 81.25 to 71.63 percent. The airplane pushed back from the gate, and taxied to runway 18L. At the time of penetration, the nose wheel was in the air, and the main landing gear was just becoming airborne. The takeoff roll was normal until passing approximately 150 knots; at that point, a flock of birds traveling from left to right passed in front of the airplane. While taxing, the crew heard no mention of a bird hazard by another aircraft or air traffic control.",0

"It was night, visibility was approximately 4 miles, and both the right and left fuel tanks indicated empty.

He activated his flight plan, requested and received radar traffic advisories, and climbed to an altitude of 7,500 feet msl. The pilot started to doubted his initial assessment that the right gauge was faulty, so decided to make an off airport precautionary landing to a field. Five gallons of fuel in the left tank, and 6 gallons in the right tank were found. The pilot had a 130 hours of total flight experience. The commutation radio, navigation radio, transponder and alternator were tested and found to function properly.

The helicopter's left spring-steel extension had the paint scraped off the upper outboard corner along the length of the extension. He added that he was '2 feet off the deck and turning to the left at the same time.' The surviving passenger stated that it felt as if 'the rear end of the aircraft either got pushed or pulled down.' He added that the nose pitched up violently and then the helicopter bounced (from side-to-side) on the platform. Under the gouge there was a paint chip. The pilot realized that he did not have enough room to land, and pulled up on the collective in an attempt to get away from the platform. The pilot stated that as soon as he lifted the helicopter off the platform, he 'felt that something wasn't normal.' The helicopter then rolled inverted and descended into the water on the north side of the platform. On the bottom side of the deformed handle there was a rolled gouge of metal.

"Additionally, the eyewitnesses all stated that it appeared that the airplane stalled with the wings wavering side to side, before the left wing dropped right before ground impact. The private pilot and his family were planning on departing the airport, which had a density altitude of 6,400 feet msl. The pilot estimated his airspeed at 70 knots when he lifted the airplane off the ground. The airport was reporting that the winds were from 240 degrees at 13 knots gusting to 19 knots at the time of the departure on runway 28. According to the manufacturer, if the airplane took off with zero flaps and full power at 85 knots, the airplane should have climbed out at a 450-foot-per-minute rate of climb. The aircraft was recovered after the accident and an engine examination and operational check was conducted. Magneto to engine timing was checked and found to be within manufacturer's limits. Eyewitnesses to the accident said the airplane appeared to be slow and not climbing in a very nose high attitude after liftoff. Additionally, the throttle and mixture controls were observed to operate to their full travel limits, and continuity was established to the cockpit. It was later determined that the airplane lifted off approximately 2/10 mile from the departure end of the runway. The engine was run-up to full throttle with no abnormal condition noted.",0

The aircraft was recovered after the accident and an engine examination and operational check was conducted. Additionally, the eyewitnesses all stated that it appeared that the airplane stalled with the wings wavering side to side, before the left wing dropped right before ground impact. The private pilot and his family were planning on departing the airport, which had a density altitude of 6,400 feet msl. The pilot estimated his airspeed at 70 knots when he lifted the airplane off the ground. Additionally, the throttle and mixture controls were observed to operate to their full travel limits, and continuity was established to the cockpit. The engine was run-up to full throttle with no abnormal condition noted. Eyewitnesses to the accident said the airplane appeared to be slow and not climbing in a very nose high attitude after liftoff. The airport was reporting that the winds were from 240 degrees at 13 knots gusting to 19 knots at the time of the departure on runway 28.

"The pilot reported the fuel gauge registered 40 gallons, so he departed. The pilot turned toward the shoreline, reduced airspeed, and ditched about 0.25 miles off shore. However, because of the airframe damage sustained during immersion in the salt water and the subsequent destruction to components, the Safety Board was unable to document the integrity of the fuel quantity indicator system. The overnight tide/wave action subsequently beached most of the airplane. The pilot rocked the airplane's wings and experienced a 'short surge of power.' The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) coordinator examined recovered portions of the airframe and engines. In the pilot's report, he did not indicate having experienced any mechanical malfunctions. Prior to departure the pilot believed that his airplane contained between 30 and 40 gallons of fuel, adequate for a 15-minute-long flight to another airport where he could purchase additional fuel. In pertinent part, the FAA reported finding no physical evidence of any mechanical malfunction with the examined components. However, it lasted only a brief moment and all engine power was again totally lost. During initial climb upon reaching an altitude of about 400 feet above the ocean, both engines simultaneously lost power.",0

"The sale was not completed based upon the results of a pre-sale inspection. However, the swath cut through the trees at the accident site was approximately 030 degrees magnetic. The airplane descended, then leveled off, then descended again, and impacted terrain around an elevation of 1,750 feet. Radar coverage revealed that, during the approximately 35-minute flight, the airplane climbed to, and maintained 8,700 feet until about 3 minutes prior to the accident. The pilot was returning from a business trip where he had attempted to sell the airplane. No flight plan was filed, and the pilot was never in contact with air traffic control facilities. In flight, the airplane's track over the ground had been about 325 degrees magnetic. The estimated rate of the final decent was initially 1,800 feet per minute, which increased to 6,400 feet per minute. The private pilot received his certificate less than 4 months earlier. The pilot was seen as visibly upset, and departed the airport for his home field. The airplane was destroyed when it impacted mountainous terrain at a 55-degree descent angle.",0

Subsequently, radio and radar contact were lost. No anomalies were found with the airframe or engine that would have prevented normal operation. A witness reported hearing the sound of the airplane's engine stop running and observed the airplane descending from the dark clouds in a nose down attitude and rotating clockwise. The pilot requested and was cleared to deviate to the north. The airplane was equipped with an autopilot, weather radar, and an ice protection system. The wreckage of the airplane was scattered along an area of about four miles. At the time of the accident the pilot had accumulated a total of 21.4 hours in the make and model of the accident aircraft. Residents of the area reported that the weather at the time of the accident was high ceilings with heavy rain just before and after the accident.",0

The location of the collision with the wires was located by the FAA inspectors with the assistance of the power company. The broken wire was found at the location where the railroad tracks make a shallow right turn. The engine sputtered, but then continued to run normally. Paint transfers on portions of the severed wire matched the color scheme of the wings. While en route, the pilot heard a loud pop and saw a bright flash of light. The ceilings continued to drop to about 300 feet, when the pilot elected to execute a 180 degree turn and return to Grand Prairie. The operator reported that soon after departure, the pilot encountered lowering ceilings while en route to a nearby non-towered airport. The pilot reported that he was following the railroad tracks southbound at low altitude en route to the non-towered airport when he collided with powerlines.",0

"According to the pilot, he landed the helicopter on the platform with the tail rotor over a stairwell in order to land into the wind and avoid a crane operating on the platform. The front seat passenger was helping the other passenger unload cargo from the helicopter and observed the worker come up the steps into the turning blades. Simultaneously, the rear passenger began to exit the helicopter without receiving authorization. According to the passengers, the pilot never indicated to them that he intended to reposition the helicopter. The helicopter was still 'light on the skids,' and he began to reposition the helicopter so the tail rotor would not be over the stairwell. The helicopter was not damaged. Subsequently, one of the passengers notified the pilot that someone had walked into the tail rotor blades. The pilot terminated the repositioning by lowering the collective and rolling the throttle to the idle position. Both passengers exited the helicopter upon hearing the engine power 'spool down.'

"The flight attitude required by the asymmetric power also induced a periodic unporting condition in the outboard fuel tank pick-ups. The pilot said he was unsuccessful in maintaining consistent engine power output and was forced to ditch 20 miles short of the coastline. The pilot's VFR flight plan indicated that the total time en route would be 13 hours 10 minutes and total fuel onboard was 14 hours. He advised Oakland Center of his position and situation, but did not declare an emergency. The pilot reported that about 150 miles southwest of Monterey, the right engine made unusual noises, began to run rough, and exhibited high cylinder head temperature at the limits of the gauge. He then increased fuel flow to the right engine in order to cool it and eventually had to reduce power on that side to keep it running. To compensate for the power loss in the right engine, he had to add power to the left engine. The pilot attempted to open the right engine cowl flap; however, it malfunctioned. The combination of remedial actions increased the fuel consumption beyond his planned fuel burn rate. The pilot said he was forced to switch to the inboard tanks until that supply was exhausted and then attempted to feed from the outboard tanks.

ABOUT 12 TO 15 GALLONS OF FUEL WERE RETRIEVED FROM THE LEFT WING, AND AN UNDETERMNED AMOUNT OF FUEL DRIPPED FROM THE LEFT TANK THROUGH A DAMAGED FUEL LINE. DURING AN INTENTIONAL MANEUVER TO AVOID A HOME, THE AIRPLANE STALLED, COLLIDED WITH TREES, AND FELL TO THE GROUND. THE RIGHT FUEL TANK WAS TORN OPEN; NO FUEL STAINS WERE NOTED AROUND THE TEAR AND NO FUEL WAS NOTED ON THE FROZEN GROUND BELOW THE RIGHT FUEL TANK. FUEL AND AIRPLANE RECORDS REVEALED THE AIRPLANE HAD FLOWN 3.1 HOURS SINCE IT WAS LAST REFUELED. AT A 75% POWER SETTING, FUEL FLOW IS ABOUT 10.5 GALLONS PER HOURS. EACH FUEL TANK HOLDS 25 GALLONS OF FUEL, OF WHICH ONE GALLON IS UNUSABLE.",0
