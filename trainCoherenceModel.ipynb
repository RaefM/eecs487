      "Routine air work was performed and then touch-and-go landing practice was planned. The approach and landing on runway 34 was normal. During the takeoff roll the pilot noticed that unusual stick forces were required to raise the tail wheel. FAA inspectors examined the airplane and did not report finding any trim or control system irregularity; however, the fuselage distortion precluded a complete examination. He saw a row of sailplanes parked on runway 30 in his path and elected to turn off the runway into sagebrush and grass. He decided to abort the takeoff and applied forward stick to prevent the airplane from leaping off the runway in a stalled condition. The trim setting was rechecked and confirmed. The pilot added some additional nose down trim, but no relief of stick pressure was noticed. He was drifting to the right and approaching the intersection of runway 30 at this time. The right main landing gear fell into a ditch and collapsed, buckling and distorting the fuselage. Trim was reset for takeoff, the checklist was completed, and power was added.\n",
